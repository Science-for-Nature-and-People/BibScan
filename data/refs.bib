Abstract = {{Grasslands can be diverse assemblages of grasses and forbs but not much
   is known how perennial grass species management affects native plant
   diversity except in a few instances. We studied the use of late-spring
   prescribed burns over a span of 11 years where the perennial grass Poa
   secunda was the foundation species, with four additional years of
   measurements after the final burn. We evaluated burn effects on P.
   secunda, the rare native annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora and local
   native and exotic species. Annual burning maintained P. secunda number,
   resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass
   cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native
   forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years
   maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion,
   and resulted in the highest native forb cover with a low exotic grass
   cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once
   from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest
   exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground.
   P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn.
   While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3
   years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment.
   A. grandiflora did not occur naturally at the site; therefore, no seed
   bank was present to provide across-year protection from the effects of
   the burns. Thus,perennial grass species management must also consider
   other native species life history and phenology to enhance native flora
   diversity.}},

Title = {{Summer water in a restored native grassland flushes annual grass seed
   bank but fails to increase native perennial cover}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natural and artificial flushing of the weed seed bank, followed by
   killing of seedlings, is a common practice in agricultural and
   prerestoration settings, but its application for post-restoration
   management has not been tested in the context of restored native plants.
   Summer watering at already restored sites could reduce exotic annual
   grass cover by decreasing the seed bank, thereby increasing native
   perennial success in subsequent growing seasons. Five replicated
   watering treatments of 11.35 L per watering event were applied for up to
   a 4 week period, with watering events ranging from once daily for a
   minimum or four and maximum of 16 d, or twice daily for 4 d, for a total
   of 45.4-181.7 L water applied in each 1-m(2) plot. Two of the watering
   treatments triggered significant flushing of annual grasses: watering
   for a total of 16 d once per day, and 4 d twice per day. Although this
   conferred a short-term reduction in annual grass emergence at the start
   of the subsequent rainy season, it did not reduce total annual cover at
   peak flowering in the growing season, or provide a longer term advantage
   to native perennial grasses. It is possible that there are sufficient
   seeds in the seed bank that this at least partly compensated for the
   seed bank reduction and did not result in a reduction in final cover, or
   that lower densities of seedlings are sufficient to achieve ``total{''}
   cover. Perennial grass cover increased in response to all watering
   treatments, but this did not result in significantly increased cover the
   following year. These results suggest that even watering treatments that
   produce large flushes of exotic annual grasses are insufficient to
   reduce exotic cover longer term. It should be explored whether more
   water, applied more frequently, could be effective in reducing the
   exotic grass seed bank enough to confer a long-term reduction in exotic
   cover and a benefit to native perennial grasses.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2643-2652}},

Abstract = {{Despite obvious impacts of nonnative species in many ecosystems, the
   long-term outcome of competition between native and exotic species often
   remains unclear. Demographic models can resolve the outcome of
   competition between native and exotic species and provide insight into
   conditions favoring exclusion vs. coexistence. California grasslands are
   one of the most heavily invaded ecosystems in North America. Although
   California native perennial bunchgrasses are thought to be restricted to
   a fraction of their original abundance, the eventual outcome of
   competition with invasive European annual grasses at a local scale
   (competitive exclusion, stable persistence, or priority effects) remains
   unresolved. Here, we used a two-species discrete time population growth
   model to predict the outcome of competition between exotic annual and
   native perennial grasses in California, and to determine the demographic
   traits responsible for the outcome. The model is parameterized with
   empirical data from several field experiments. We found that, once
   introduced, annual grasses persist stably with little uncertainty.
   Although perennial grasses are competitively excluded on average, the
   most likely range of model predictions also includes stable coexistence
   with annual grasses. As for many other perennial plants, native
   bunchgrass population growth is highly sensitive to the survival of
   adults. Management interventions that improve perennial adult survival
   are likely to be more effective than those that reduce exotic annual
   seed production or establishment, reduce competition, or increase
   perennial seedling establishment. Further empirical data on summer
   survival of bunchgrass adults and competitive effects of annuals on
   perennials would most improve model predictions because they contribute
   most to the uncertainty in the predicted outcome for the perennial
   grass. This work demonstrates how demographic approaches can clarify the
   outcome of competition between native and exotic species, identify key
   targets for future empirical work, and predict the effectiveness of
   management interventions. Such studies are critical both for
   understanding the impacts of invasion and for targeting management
   responses that maximize the benefit to native species.}},

Abstract = {{Southern California grasslands have largely been type-converted to
   dominance by exotic annual grasses, leading to displacement of many
   native grass and forb species. Crimson fountaingrass, Pennisetum
   setaceum, an exotic perennial C-4 species and a relatively new invader
   to California, is expanding to areas currently occupied by purple
   needlegrass, Stipa pulchra, a C-3 native. We predicted that
   fountaingrass seedlings might withstand cool season competition in
   California's Mediterranean-type climate and establish in Stipa pulchra
   grasslands due to less competition during the warm, dry summer season,
   and that interactions might be influenced by density. A field experiment
   was conducted to examine competitive interactions of the two species
   from the cool winter season to the warm summer season. As predicted,
   Stipa produced greater abovegroundbiomass in the cool season and showed
   strong intraspecific competition, as well as interspecific suppression
   of Pennisetum growth, whereas Pennisetum showed no suppression of Stipa.
   In the warm season, Stipa showed relatively less suppression of
   Pennisetum, erasing significant differences, and Pennisetum showed
   increased growth. Results of this study show that C-3 Stipa can suppress
   initial growth of C-4 Pennisetum in the cool season, but in warmer
   months, Pennisetum can overcome this initial suppression at both low and
   high densities, even within a Mediterranean-type climate with little to
   no summer rainfall. Thus, in southern California, temporal niche
   partitioning due to photosynthetic pathway in these two species can
   allow Pennisetum invasion. Given the similarity in life history and
   growth form of Stipa and Pennisetum, few options exist for controlling
   Pennisetum in habitats where Stipa occurs. In these cases, restoration
   plantings of desirable species are essential in order to reestablish
   competitive vegetation that will be more resistant to invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal priority can affect individual performance and reproduction, as
   well as community assembly, but whether these effects persist over time
   remains unclear, and their demographic mechanisms have been little
   explored. The continued dominance of exotic annual grasses in California
   has been commonly attributed to their demonstrated early germination and
   rapid early growth relative to native perennial grasses. This advantage
   may play a crucial role in the structure of California exotic annual
   grasslands, as well as in the practice of native grassland restoration.
   We tested whether a two-week planting advantage under field conditions
   increased individual survival, growth, and reproduction for four native
   perennial grass species and whether these effects persisted over three
   years. We show that short-term priority significantly increased the
   establishment success of native perennial grasses. Increased density of
   native grass seedlings presaged later large increases in cover that were
   not evident in the first year after planting. Although priority effects
   at the individual level may diminish over time, short differences in
   emergence timing can have long-lasting effects on community structure.
   Earlier germination and faster initial growth of exotic annual species
   may help explain their unprecedented invasion and continued dominance of
   California grasslands. Finally, these results highlight the importance
   of priority effects for effective exotic annual control during native
   grassland restoration in California: initial control can increase the
   establishment of native perennial seedlings, which then results in
   long-term control by mature native individuals.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Ecological communities are increasingly being recognized as the products
   of contemporary drivers and historical legacies that are both biotic and
   abiotic. In an attempt to unravel multiple layers of ecological
   contingency, we manipulated (i) competition with exotic annual grasses,
   (ii) the timing of this competition (temporal priority in
   arrival/seeding times) and (iii) watering (simulated rainfall) in a
   restoration-style planting of native perennial grasses. In addition, we
   replicated this experiment simultaneously at three sites in
   north-central California. Native perennial grasses had 73-99 \% less
   cover when planted with exotic annuals than when planted alone, but this
   reduction was greatly ameliorated by planting the natives 2 weeks prior
   to the exotics. In a drought year, irrigation significantly reduced
   benefits of early planting so that these benefits resembled those
   observed in a non-drought year. There were significant differences
   across the three sites (site effects and interactions) in (i) overall
   native cover, (ii) the response of natives to competition, (iii) the
   strength of the temporal priority effect and (iv) the degree to which
   supplemental watering reduced priority effects. These results reveal the

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-85}},

Abstract = {{Plant invasion and restoration outcomes are largely driven by the timing
   and magnitude of seed dispersal, and by the performance of dispersed
   species in an environment. Because seed dispersal controls recruitment
   of newly arriving species and facilitates safe site occupation, assembly
   will differ depending on seed dispersal processes and variable
   environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to identify
   how annual and perennial grasses assembled when dispersal times,
   propagule pressure, and water availability were modified. To assess
   these effects, we conducted a field experiment in an annual grass
   invaded shrub-steppe ecosystem in eastern Oregon. We tested the effects
   of seeding annual and perennial grasses in autumn or delaying annual
   grass seeding until spring, adding water, and varying annual and
   perennial grass seeding rate by 150, 1,500, 2,500, or 3,500 seeds m(-2)
   on perennial and annual grass seedling emergence through time and final
   density and biomass. Providing perennial grasses a priority effect by
   delaying annual grass seeding until spring initially facilitated
   perennial grass establishment, but this effect did not persist into the
   second growing season. We found that if annual grass propagule pressure
   exceeded 150 seeds m(-2), perennial grass recruitment was limited. In
   addition, higher water availability increased perennial grass
   establishment, but was dependent upon annual grass propagule pressure.
   These findings suggest that seeding perennial grasses into annual grass
   dominated systems is more dependent upon the existing propagule pressure
   of annual grasses than the priority effects of perennial grasses, the
   propagule pressure of perennial grasses, or water availability.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies often suggest that diverse communities are most
   resistant to invasion by exotic plants, but relatively few local species
   may be available to a rehabilitation practitioner. We examine the
   ability of monocultures and diverse assemblages to resist invasion by an
   exotic annual grass (cheatgrass) and an exotic biennial forb (dyer's
   woad) in experimental rehabilitation plots. We constructed seven
   assemblages that included three monocultures of grass, forb, or shrub;
   three four-species mixtures of grasses, forbs, or shrubs; and a
   three-species mixture of one species from each growth form in an
   experimental field setting to test resistance to invasion. Assemblages
   were seeded with cheatgrass and dyer's woad for two consecutive years
   and quantified as biomass and density of individuals from each exotic
   species. Soil NO3- and leaf-area index were examined as predictors of
   invasive plant abundance. Cheatgrass invasion was greatest in forb and
   shrub assemblages, and least in mixed grass or grass monoculture; dyer's
   woad invasion was greatest into mixed grass or grass monoculture, but
   least into monoculture or mixedspecies assemblages composed of forbs or
   shrubs. The community composed of grasses, forbs, and shrubs suppressed
   invasion by both species. Consequently, assemblages were most resistant
   to invasion by species of the same growth form. Moreover, these
   monocultures and mixtures were generally similar in conferring
   resistance to invasion, but a monoculture of big sagebrush was more
   resistant than a mixture of shrubs. Soil NO3- was correlated with
   invasion by cheatgrass, whereas LAI was correlated with invasion by
   dyer's woad, suggesting these species were more limited by belowground
   and aboveground resources, respectively. Overall, increasing diversity
   with limited species did not necessarily enhance resistance to invasion.}},

Title = {{Do Tree Canopies Enhance Perennial Grass Restoration in California Oak
   Savannas?}},
Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{574-581}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Scattered trees in grass-dominated ecosystems often act as islands of
   fertility with important influences on community structure. Despite the
   potential for these islands to be useful in restoring degraded
   rangelands, they can also serve as sites for the establishment of fast
   growing non-native species. In California oak savannas, native perennial
   grasses are rare beneath isolated oaks and non-native annual grasses
   dominate. To understand the mechanisms generating this pattern, and the
   potential for restoration of native grasses under oaks, we asked: what
   are the effects of the tree under-story environment, the abundance of a
   dominant non-native annual grass (Bromus diandrus), and soils beneath
   the trees on survival, growth, and reproduction of native perennial
   grass seedlings? We found oak canopies had a strong positive effect on
   survival of Stipa pulchra and Poa secunda. Growth and reproduction was
   enhanced by the canopy for Poa but negatively impacted for Stipa. We
   also found that Bromus suppressed growth and reproduction in Stipa and
   Poa, although less so for Stipa. These results suggest the oak
   understory may enhance survival of restored native perennial grass
   seedlings. The presence of exotic grasses can also suppress growth of
   native grasses, although only weakly for Stipa. The current limitation
   of native grasses to outside the canopy edge is potentially the result
   of interference from annual grasses under oaks, especially for
   short-statured grasses like Poa. Therefore, control of non-native annual
   grasses under tree canopies will enhance the establishment of S. pulchra
   and P. secunda when planted in California oak savannas.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The spread of medusahead across the western United States has severe
   implications for a wide range of ecosystem services. Medusahead invasion
   reduces biodiversity, wildlife habitat and forage production, and often
   leads to increased fire frequency and restoration costs. Medusahead is
   problematic in the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands.
   The last review of medusahead ecology and management was completed 20
   years ago. Since the last review, there have been scientific advances in
   medusahead management suggesting a significant need to develop an
   up-to-date synthesis. Medusahead continues to pose a serious threat to
   rangeland ecosystems. In this synthesis, we present new information
   regarding the ecology of medusahead, suggest a framework for managing
   medusahead based on invasion level, and identify research needs to
   further improve management of this invasive annual grass. Success of
   different management practices varies between the Intermountain West and
   California Annual Grasslands, signifying that the best management
   practices are those specifically tailored with consideration of climate,
   soil, plant community characteristics, and management objectives.
   Prevention and control treatments that are useful in the Intermountain
   West may not be practical or effective in the California Annual
   Grasslands and vice-versa.}},

Title = {{Genetic variation among mainland and island populations of a native
   perennial grass used in restoration}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Genetic marker studies can assist restoration practice through selection
   of seed sources that conserve historical levels of gene diversity and
   population genetic differentiation. We examined genetic variation and
   structure within and among mainland and island populations of Elymus
   glaucus, a perennial bunchgrass species native to western North American
   grasslands that is targeted for grassland restoration. Island
   populations of E. glaucus represent sensitive sites and potentially
   distinctive seed sources for reintroduction, and little is known of
   their genetic composition. Genetic diversity and structure were
   estimated using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers for 21
   populations and 416 individuals distributed across two coastal
   California mainland locations and three California Channel Islands.
   Eight primer combinations resulted in 166 markers, of which 165 (99.4
   \%) were polymorphic. The number of polymorphic bands was significantly
   greater among mainland populations relative to island sites, and locally
   common alleles were present for each sampled island and mainland
   location. Population structure was high (62.9 \%), with most variation
   (55.8 \%) distributed among populations, 7.1 \% between mainland and
   island locations, and the remainder (37.1 \%) within populations.
   Isolation by distance was only apparent among islands. Using marker data
   to recommend appropriate seed sources for restoration, E. glaucus seeds
   are best derived within islands with collections representing a large
   number of individuals from matching environments. Given the limited gene
   flow and prior evidence of adaptive divergence among populations of this
   species, regional collections are recommended in all cases to maintain
   diversity and to avoid long-distance introductions of highly
   differentiated plant material.}},

Abstract = {{Downy brome or cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and medusahead (Taeniatherum
   caput-medusae) are the most problematic invasive annual grasses in
   rangelands of the western United States, including sagebrush communities
   that provide habitat to sage grouse. Rehabilitation of infested sites
   requires effective weed control strategies combined with seeding of
   native plants or desirable competitive species. In this study, we
   evaluated the effect of three fall-applied pre-emergence herbicides
   (imazapic, rimsulfuron, and chlorsulfuron+sulfometuron), and one
   spring-applied postemergence herbicide (glyphosate) on the control of
   downy brome and medusahead and the response of seeded perennial species
   and resident vegetation in two sagebrush communities in northeastern
   California. All pre-emergence treatments gave >93\% control of both
   invasive species at both sites in the first year. Glyphosate was less
   consistent, giving > 94\% control at one site and only 61\% control of
   both species at the other site. Imazapic was the only herbicide to
   maintain good control (78-88\%) of both species 2 yr after treatment. No
   herbicide caused detectible long-term damage to either perennial grasses
   or annual forbs, and imazapic treatment resulted in an increase in
   resident native forb cover 3 yr after treatment. Broadcast seeding with
   or without soil incorporation did not result in successful establishment
   of perennial species, probably due to below-average precipitation in the
   year of seeding. These results indicate that several chemical options
   can give short-term control of downy brome and medusahead. Over the
   course of the study, imazapic provided the best management of both
   invasive annual grasses while increasing native forb cover.}},

Abstract = {{To resist establishment by an invasive plant, a community may require
   one or more species functionally similar to the invader in their
   resource acquisition pattern. In this study, communities consisting of
   native winter annual forbs, non-native annual grasses, native
   perennials, or a combination of the two native communities were
   established with and without Centaurea solstitialis to determine the
   effect of soil moisture and light availability on plant community
   invasion resistance. The annual plant communities were unable to resist
   invasion by C. solstitialis. In the native winter annual forb community,
   senescence in late spring increased light penetration (> 75\%) to the
   soil surface, allowing seeded C. solstitialis to quickly establish and
   dominate the plots. In addition, native annual forbs utilized only
   shallow soil moisture, whereas C. solstitialis used shallow and deep
   soil moisture. In communities containing native perennials, only Elymus
   glaucus established well and eventually dominated the plots. During the
   first 2 years of establishment, water use pattern of perennial
   communities was similar to native annual forbs and resistance to
   invasion was associated with reduced light availability during the
   critical stages of C. solstitialis establishment. In later years,
   however, water use pattern of perennial grass communities was similar or
   greater than C. solstitialis-dominated plots. These results show that
   Central Valley grasslands that include E. glaucus resist C. solstitialis
   invasion by a combination of light suppression and soil water
   competition. Spatiotemporal resource utilization patterns, and not just
   functional similarity, should be considered when developing restoration
   strategies to resist invasion by many non-native species.}},

Abstract = {{Although rarely examined, apparent competition, whereby exotic plants
   increase consumer pressure on native plants, could play a significant
   role in affecting native plant establishment in invaded habitats.
   Moreover, although terrestrial consumer communities often contain many
   consumer species, little is known about which consumers may generate
   apparent competition, and whether the strength or mechanism of apparent
   competition differs among different members of the consumer community.
   Using consumer-specific experimental exclosures and seed additions in
   the invaded grasslands of California, we demonstrate that multiple
   mechanisms of apparent competition are capable of limiting the
   re-establishment of the native grass Nassella pulchra in the absence of
   direct competition with exotic plants. The effect of small mammalian
   consumers (mice and voles) and larger consumers (e.g. rabbits,
   squirrels, deer) decreased with distance to the exotic forb Brassica
   nigra, which varied from 0-33 meters from focal N. pulchra. The effect
   of larger consumers also depended upon characteristics of the plant
   community directly adjacent (i.e. approx. 1 m) from focal N. pulchra.
   The effect of large consumers also increased with the richness of the
   exotic plant community and the degree to which the exotic plant
   community was dominated by exotic grasses as opposed to exotic forbs.
   Our finding that apparent competition can be driven by different
   mechanisms, that the importance of each mechanism depends upon which
   consumers have access, and that each mechanism has a different spatial
   extent, suggests that the composition of both the consumer community and
   the exotic plant community may shape the spatial dynamics of
   reestablishment, the potential for restoration, and the need for
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Plant community functional composition can be manipulated in restored
   ecosystems to reduce the establishment potential of invading species.
   This study was designed to compare invasion resistance among communities
   with species functionally similar or dissimilar to yellow starthistle
   (Centaurea solstitialis), a late-season annual. A field experiment was
   conducted in the Central Valley of California with six experimental
   plant communities that included (1) six early-season native annual forbs
   (AF); (2) five late-season native perennials and one summer annual forb
   (NP); (3) a combination of three early-season native annual forbs and
   three late-season native perennials (FP); (4) six early-season
   non-native annual grasses (AG); (5) monoculture of the late-season
   native perennial grass Elymus glaucus (EG); and (6) monoculture of the
   late-season native perennial Grindelia camporum (GC). Following
   establishment, C. solstitialis seed was added to half of the plots, and
   a monoculture of C. solstitialis (CS) was established as a control. Over
   a 5-year period, the AF and AG communities were ineffective at
   preventing C. solstitialis invasion. Centaurea solstitialis cover
   remained less than 10\% in the FP and NP communities, except in year 1.
   By the fourth year, E. glaucus cover was greater than 50\% in NP and FP
   communities and had spread to all other communities (e.g., 27\% cover in
   CS in year 5). Communities containing E. glaucus, which is functionally
   similar to C. solstitialis, better resisted invasion than communities
   lacking a functional analog. In contrast, G. camporum, which is also
   functionally similar to C. solstitialis, failed to survive.
   Consequently, species selection for restored communities must consider
   not only functional similarity to the invader but also establishment
   success, competitiveness, and survivorship.}},

Abstract = {{As valuation of ecosystem goods and services derived from ecological
   processes becomes increasingly important in environmental
   decision-making, the need to quantify how restoration activities
   influence ecosystem function has grown more urgent, particularly within
   income-generating or subsistence-providing landscapes where economic
   needs and biodiversity goals must be balanced. However, quantification
   of restoration effects is often hindered by logistical issues, which
   include (1) the difficulty of systematically monitoring responses over
   large areas and (2) lack or loss of comparison sites necessary for
   assessing treatment effect. We explored the use of remote sensing to
   quantify the effects of native grass seeding and prescribed burns on
   ecosystem forage provisioning services within a California (U.S.A.)
   rangeland landscape. We used Landsat time series to monitor forage
   (green biomass) dynamics within 296 ha of treatment areas-distributed
   throughout a 36-km(2) watershed-for 6 years and to identify post hoc
   comparison areas when a priori comparisons were lacking. Remote sensing
   analysis documented gains and losses in forage provisioning services due
   to restoration efforts and provided critical information for adaptive
   management. Our results demonstrate the degree to which invaded
   grasslands can be resistant to change and suggest that increasing the
   functional complexity of restoration mixes might help increase forage
   availability and reduce opportunities for weed reinvasion.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the most appropriate combination of treatments to
   reintroduce Nassella pulchra, a perennial bunchgrass, into degraded
   mediterranean coastal grasslands?
   Location: Central coast of California, USA.
   Methods: N. pulchra was sown from seeds and transplanted into a degraded
   grassland in a multi-factorial experiment testing the effects of (1) two
   grazing intensities (lightly grazed by native mammal species or
   ungrazed); (2) topsoil removal and (3) reduction of plant neighbours.
   The experiment was carried out on two types of surrounding vegetation
   (exotic annual grasses and exotic forbs).
   Results: Topsoil removal greatly enhanced establishment from seeds and
   transplant survival, mainly because it reduced the exotic vegetation and
   thus reduced competition. While removing neighbours was essential when
   topsoil was left intact, it had a negative effect on N. pulchra when
   surrounding species included exotic forbs (Brassica spec. and
   Asteraceae) at low density (after topsoil removal). Moderate grazing by
   native mammals (deer, rabbits and gophers) did not affect N. pulchra.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that seeding after topsoil has been
   removed is a promising method to reintroduce N. pulchra to highly
   degraded sites where there is little to no native seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between community diversity and the stability of summed
   community biomass has been an area of great theoretical and empirical
   interest in basic ecology. In general, it has been found that the
   complementary/compensatory dynamics among species that comprise a
   community can stabilize aggregate measures of community biomass.
   Although the potential importance of diversity-stability relationships
   to restoration ecology has been recognized, to date there has been no
   quantification of the role these relationships play in increasing the
   persistence of restored communities in the face of altered disturbance
   regimes, climatic variability, and over the course of succession. In a
   large-scale experimental restoration of a California grassland
   community, aggregated abundance of restored grasses was more stable than
   were the individual species in response to disturbance, drought, and
   succession. Compensatory dynamics among the restored grass flora
   increased aggregate stability in response to natural and anthropogenic
   disturbances. Successful restorations must persist in the face of
   altered management and disturbance regimes, climactic variability, and
   over the course of succession. Incorporation of diversity-stability
   relationships into restoration plans will likely increase restoration
   success. This case study further demonstrates the relevance of community
   ecology theory to restoration ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive annual grasses, such as medusahead, can reduce forage
   production capacity and interfere with revegetation projects in
   California rangelands. Because of the taxonomic similarity to other more
   desirable grasses, achieving selective control of invasive annual
   grasses can be difficult. In selectivity trials conducted in Yolo and
   Siskiyou counties, CA, the herbicide imazapic gave control of many
   normative annual grasses yet provided some level of selectivity to
   specific perennial grasses used in revegetation projects throughout the
   western United States. The selectivity difference between newly seeded
   perennial and annual grasses was greater with PRE applications than with
   POST treatments. Both perennial and annual grasses within the tribe
   Hordeae were more tolerant to imazapic than other grass species. In
   addition, field experiments were conducted at three sites in northern
   California (Yuba, Yolo, and Lassen counties) and one in southern Oregon
   (Lake County) to test the response of imazapic to varying management
   conditions. Imazapic was applied PRE in fall (and also spring in Lake
   County) at rates from 35 to 210 g/ha on undisturbed rangeland, in
   comparison with rangeland cleared of standing plant material and thatch
   by either tillage, mowing and raking, or burning. Imazapic generally
   showed enhanced weed control when applied following disturbance. Rates
   as low as 70 g/ha, if combined with thatch removal, provided significant
   suppression of medusahead. In addition, disturbance alone generally
   reduced medusahead cover in the following year. Although imazapic showed
   potential for control of medusahead and other annual grasses, its
   selectivity window was relatively narrow.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices have strong impacts on soil microbes including
   both the indices related to biomass and activity as well as those
   related to community composition. In a grassland restoration project in
   California, where native perennial bunchgrasses were introduced into
   non-native annual grassland after a period of intensive tillage,
   weeding, and herbicide use to reduce the annual seed bank, microbial
   community composition was investigated. Three treatments were compared:
   annual grassland, bare soil fallow, and restored perennial grassland.
   Soil profiles down to 80 cm in depth were investigated in four separate
   layers (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-80 cm) using both phospholipid
   ester-linked fatty acid (PLFAs) and ergosterol as biomarkers in addition
   to microbial biomass C by fumigation extraction. PLFA fingerprinting
   showed much stronger differences between the tilled bare fallow
   treatment vs. grasslands, compared to fewer differences between restored
   perennial grassland and annual grassland. The presence or absence of
   plants over several years clearly distinguished microbial communities.
   Microbial communities in lower soil layers were little affected by
   management practices. Regardless of treatment, soil depth caused a
   strong gradient of changing habitat conditions, which was reflected in
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis of PLFAs. Fungal organisms were
   associated with the presence of plants and/or litter since the total
   amount and the relative proportion of fungal markers were reduced in the
   tilled bare fallow and in lower layers of the grassland treatments.
   Total PLFA and soil microbial biomass were highly correlated, and fungal
   PLFA biomarkers showed strong correlations to ergosterol content. In
   conclusion, microbial communities are resilient to the grassland
   restoration process, but do not reflect the change in plant species
   composition that occurred after planting native bunchgrasses. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{The threat posed by invasive nonnative plants to native plant
   populations is one of the largest challenges facing both conservation
   biology and restoration ecology. California has been highly impacted by
   invaders, although many relict stands of native plants are found on
   shallow, rocky soils with limited resources. The abiotic conditions of
   these sites may strongly influence the performance of an invasive plant
   and its effect on resident native species. In addition, the maturity of
   native plants in these sites may modulate an invader's impact; larger,
   well-established plants may be better able to resist invaders. In this
   study we examined how the impact of an invasive thistle (Centaurea
   solstitialis) on a native perennial bunchgrass (Nassella pulchra)
   changed in response to variation in soil depth, soil water availability,
   and bunchgrass maturity. We measured plant performance in terms of
   survival, growth, reproduction, and predawn water potential. We found
   that soil depth, water availability, and bunchgrass maturity acted in
   concert to influence the impact of the invasive thistle on the native
   bunchgrass. Both species performed better in deep soils, especially
   during dry years. The combination of shallow soil and low water
   availability reduced C. solstitialis performance and ameliorated its
   negative effect on N. pulchra growth and reproduction. Higher water
   availability resulted in a stronger negative effect of C. solstitialis
   on N. pulchra in both shallow and deep soils. However, as N. pulchra
   matured and increased in size, we saw a steady decline in C.

   high-rainfall years. However, established stands of N. pulchra appear to
   be more resistant to invasion by C. solstitialis as N. pulchra plants

Title = {{Restoring ecological function in temperate grassy woodlands:
   manipulating soil nutrients, exotic annuals and native perennial grasses
   through carbon supplements and spring burns}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological invasions are often associated with persistent changes to
   underlying ecological processes. Restoration of invaded communities is
   dependent on manipulation of these processes to favour the target
   species composition and impart resistance to further invasion. We
   applied these principles to extensively degraded grassy woodlands in
   temperate agricultural regions of Australia, where widespread invasion
   by mediterranean annuals is related to altered ecological processes such
   as soil nutrient cycling.
   2. We investigated carbon supplementation and spring burns, in
   association with re-establishment of native perennial grasses, as
   potential management tools for manipulating nitrogen cycling, soil seed
   banks and establishment conditions in degraded woodland understoreys.
   Through these mechanisms we aimed to enhance native cover and increase
   resistance to invasion by exotic annuals.
   3. In two contrasting degraded remnants, repeated sucrose applications
   temporarily reduced soil nitrate to inferred pre-European levels, which
   dramatically reduced growth of exotic annuals and enhanced native
   perennial abundance. Repeated spring burns did not reduce soil nitrate
   but reduced exotic annual grasses through effects on soil seed banks
   and/or establishment conditions.
   4. Spring burns and carbon supplements both significantly enhanced
   establishment of Themeda australis, a dominant tussock grass prior to
   European settlement. Combinations of T. australis seed addition and
   either spring burning or carbon supplements enhanced native plant
   abundance more effectively than treatments without seed addition.
   5. Within 18 months of their establishment, T. australis seedlings
   significantly reduced soil nitrate in some treatments, providing a
   preliminary indication that re-establishment of a dense sward of this
   species may restore ecosystem function to a low-nitrate state that
   favours native perennials over exotic annuals.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Ecological restoration can be viewed as
   targeted intervention in species-environment interactions, whereby
   ecological conditions are manipulated to enhance establishment or vigour
   of key species, and these species in turn help restore ecological
   processes that favour the target species composition. In grassy
   ecosystems re-establishing a perennial sward of appropriate native
   tussock grasses may be critical for restoring pre-disturbance nitrogen
   cycles and improving resistance to invasion by exotic annuals. Carbon
   supplements and spring burns facilitate this process through
   complementary mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{659-666}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands dominated by exotic annual grasses have replaced native
   perennial vegetation types in vast areas of California. Prescribed
   spring fires can cause a temporary replacement of exotic annual grasses
   by native and non-native forbs, but generally do not lead to recovery of
   native perennials, especially where these have been entirely displaced
   for many years. Successful reintroduction of perennial species after
   fire depends on establishment in the postfire environment. We studied
   the effects of vegetation changes after an April fire on competition for
   soil moisture, a key factor in exotic annual grass dominance. As an
   alternative to fire, solarization effectively kills seeds of most plant
   species but with a high labor investment per area. We compared the burn
   to solarization in a study of establishment and growth of seeds and
   transplants of the native perennial grass Purple needlegrass (Nassella
   pulchra) and coastal sage species California sagebrush (Artemisia
   californica). After the fire, initial seed bank and seedling densities
   and regular percent cover and soil moisture (0-20 cm) data were
   collected in burned and unburned areas. Burned areas had 96\% fewer
   viable seeds of the dominant annual grass, Ripgut brome (Bromus
   diandrus), leading to replacement by forbs from the seed bank,
   especially non-native Black mustard (Brassica nigra). In the early
   growing season, B. diandrus dominating unburned areas consistently
   depleted soil moisture to a greater extent between rains than forbs in
   burned areas. However, B. diandrus senesced early, leaving more moisture
   available in unburned areas after late-season rains. Nassella pulchra
   and A. californica established better on plots treated with fire and/or
   solarization than on untreated plots. We conclude that both spring burns
   and solarization can produce conditions where native perennials can
   establish in annual grasslands. However, the relative contribution of
   these treatments to restoration appears to depend on the native species
   being reintroduced, and the long-term success of these initial
   restoration experiments remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the nature of root and shoot competition can elucidate the
   competitive ability of an invasive species and direct management
   strategies. In a set of competition experiments, artichoke thistle
   (Cynara cardunculus), an exotic invasive perennial forb, was subjected
   to full or shoot competition with four species: black mustard (Brassica
   nigra), an exotic annual forb; ripgut grass (Bromus diandrus), an exotic
   annual grass; purple needle-grass (Nassella pulchra), a native perennial
   grass; and itself For shoot competition, a smaller pot nested in a
   larger experimental pot sequestered the target plant root system. A bare
   ground invasion experiment, in which all plants were transplanted on the
   same date, and a community invasion experiment, in which competitor
   species were planted 1 mo before targets, were conducted. In the bare
   ground invasion experiment, target plant size was reduced (P <= 0.05)
   when exposed to full competition with the exotic species, but not purple
   needle-grass. Effects on target plants included reductions in height,
   number of leaves, rosette diameter, and shoot and leaf dry weight. In
   the community invasion experiment, full competition with all species
   reduced target plant growth (P : 0.05). Shoot competition was more
   important when all species were planted synchronously, whereas root
   competition was more important when target plant establishment was
   delayed. In a separate experiment, artichoke thistle was grown under
   four light levels simulating field conditions under canopies of the same
   competitors. Midday carbon assimilation decreased linearly with
   increased shade, indicating the likely effects of shoot competition on
   artichoke thistle. Results indicated that exotic species are more
   competitive than native purple needle-grass against artichoke thistle
   and that restoration directly to native grassland after artichoke
   thistle removal might be difficult. However, artichoke thistle seedling
   growth is reduced by root competition from grasses that emerge earlier,
   indicating that early season management of grasslands to delay artichoke
   thistle establishment might provide effective control.}},

Abstract = {{The restoration of perennial grasslands in western North America often
   depends on effective weed control. We took advantage of a grassland
   restoration site on the Nature Conservancy's Agate Desert Preserve in
   southern Oregon (TNC 1997), where 3 sites had been previously burned,
   mowed, or both. At these sites we carried out a series of controlled,
   replicated experiments designed to test the effectiveness of 3 weed
   control measures: (1) sawdust, (2) glyphosate herbicide, and (3)
   herbicide plus an alfalfa mulch. All plots were seeded with a mix of 3
   native perennial grasses. The soils of the 3 areas differing in Previous
   vegetation management were similar, with the exception of total
   available Soil nitrogen, which was significantly lower in the 2 burned
   sites. The sawdust treatment reduced total available soil nitrogen, but
   only in the unburned site, and only in the first few months after
   application. In all 3 areas the alfalfa mulch significantly increased
   total available soil nitrogen. However, none of these soil nitrogen
   differences significantly affected the success of weeds or planted
   perennial grasses. The herbicide treatment reduced exotic annual grasses
   and forbs and greatly increased the success of native forbs and the
   planted perennial grasses. The herbicide increased both initial
   cstablislonent of the native grasses and their absolute cover and
   biomass. Those results suggest that neither nitrogen impoverishment nor
   nitrogen enrichment was a useful restoration technique at this site, but
   weed control by herbicides can be of considerable assistance in
   restoring native perennial grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Replacement of perennial grasses with non-native annual grasses in
   California's Central Valley grasslands and foothills has increased deep
   soil water availability. Yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a
   deep-rooted invasive thistle, can use this water to invade annual
   grasslands. Native perennial bunchgrasses, such as Purple needlegrass
   (Nassella pulchra), also use deep soil water, so there is an overlap in
   resource use between N. pulchra and C. solstitialis. Restoration of N.
   pulchra to annual grasslands could result in strong competitive
   interactions between N. pulchra and C. solstitialis, which may reduce
   survival, growth, and reproduction of the invader. The strength of this
   competitive interaction can increase as N. pulchra plants mature,
   increase in size, and develop more extensive root systems. We studied
   how the size of N. pulchra affected the success of C. solstitialis
   invasion over 2 years. We allowed C. solstitialis seed to fall naturally
   into plots containing N. pulchra plants. For each plot, we measured the
   number of C. solstitialis seedlings and mature plants, as well as C.
   solstitialis biomass and seedhead production. In both years of the
   study, C. solstitialis number, biomass, and seedhead production declined
   significantly as N. pulchra size increased. However, even C.
   solstitialis grown with the largest N. pulchra plants produced some
   seed, especially during the higher rainfall year. We conclude that
   restoration plantings with larger, established N. pulchra plants will be
   more resistant to invasion by C. solstitialis than young N. pulchra
   plantings, but site management must continue as long as a C.
   solstitialis seed source is present.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of California native perennial grassland is often initiated
   with cultivation to reduce the density and cover of non-native annual
   grasses before seeding with native perennials. Tillage is known to
   adversely impact agriculturally cultivated land; thus changes in soil
   biological functions, as indicated by carbon (C) turnover and C
   retention, may also be negatively affected by these restoration
   techniques. We investigated a restored perennial grassland in the fourth
   year after planting Nassella pulchra, Elymus glaucus, and Hordeum
   brachyantherum ssp. californicum for total soil C and nitrogen (N),
   microbial biomass C, microbial respiration, CO2 concentrations in the
   soil atmosphere, surface efflux of CO2, and root distribution (0- to
   15-, 15- to 30-, 30- to 60-, and 60- to 80-cm depths). A comparison was
   made between untreated annual grassland and plots without plant cover
   still maintained by tillage and herbicide. In the uppermost layer (0- to
   15-cm depth), total C, microbial biomass C, and respiration were lower
   in the tilled, bare soil than in the grassland soils, as was CO2 efflux
   from the soil surface. Root length near perennial bunchgrasses was lower
   at the surface and greater at lower depths than in the annual
   grass-dominated areas; a similar but less pronounced trend was observed
   for root biomass. Few differences in soil biological or chemical
   properties occurred below 15-cm depth, except that at lower depths, the
   CO2 concentration in the soil atmosphere was lower in the plots without
   vegetation, possibly from reduced production of CO2 due to the lack of
   root respiration. Similar microbiological properties in soil layers
   below 15-cm depth suggest that deeper microbiota rely on more
   recalcitrant C sources and are less affected by plant removal than in
   the surface layer, even after 6 years. Without primary production,
   restoration procedures with extended periods of tillage and herbicide
   applications led to net losses of C during the plant-free periods.
   However, at 4 years after planting native grasses, soil microbial
   biomass and activity were nearly the same as the former conditions
   represented by annual grassland, suggesting high resilience to the
   temporary disturbance caused by tillage.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the potential for enhancing an existing stand of native
   perennial grasses on a California Coast Range Grassland site, we
   experimentally manipulated the seasonal timing and presence of grazing
   for 3 years (1994 through 1996) and of autumn burning for 2 years (1994
   and 1995) and measured species cover for 6 years (1993 through 1998). We
   subjected the species matrix to classification (TWINSPAN) and ordination
   (CCA) and tested the ordination site scores as well as diversity indices
   with linear mixed effects models. Four distinct plant community groups
   emerged from the classification. Two of these were dominated by annual
   grasses and two by perennial grasses. No treatment effects were observed
   on diversity. For composition, temporal and spatial random effects were
   important mixed effects model parameters, as was the fixed effect
   covariate, pre-treatment CCA site score, indicating the importance of
   random environmental variation and initial starting conditions.
   Incorporation of these random effects and initial condition terms made
   for more powerful tests of the fixed effects, grazing season, and
   burning. We found no significant burning effects. Grazing removal
   imparted a shift in plant community from more annual-dominated toward
   more perennial-dominated vegetation. Individual perennial grass species
   responded differently according to genus and species. Nassella spp.
   increased gradually over time regardless of grazing. treatment. Nassella
   pulchra (purple needlegrass) increase was greatest under spring grazing
   and N. lepida (foothill needlegrass) was greatest with grazing removal.
   Danthonia californica (California oatgrass) had little response over
   time under seasonal grazing treatments, but increased with grazing
   removal. Under relatively mesic weather conditions it appears that
   grazing removal from Coast Range Grasslands with existing native
   perennial grass populations can increase their cover. However if N.
   pulchra is the sole existing population, spring season-restricted
   grazing should be equally effective at enhancing cover of the native
   grass species.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the addition of carbon (C) as sucrose or
   sawdust to the soil as a tool to reduce plant-available nitrogen (N) and
   alter competitive interactions among species. The hypothesis that C
   addition changes N availability and thereby changes competitive dynamics
   between natives and exotics was tested in a California grassland that
   had experienced N enrichment. Sawdust (1.2 kg/m) was added to plots
   containing various combinations of three native perennial bunchgrasses,
   exotic perennial grasses, and exotic annual grasses. Sawdust addition
   resulted in higher microbial biomass N, lower rates of net N
   mineralization and net nitrification, and higher concentrations of
   extractable soil ammonium in the soil. In the first year sawdust
   addition decreased the degree to which exotic annuals competitively
   suppressed the seedlings of Nassella pulchra and, to a lesser extent,
   Festuca rubra, both native grasses. However there was no evidence of
   reduced growth of exotic grasses in sawdust-amended plots. Sawdust
   addition did not influence interactions between the natives and exotic
   perennial grasses. In the second year, however, sawdust addition did not
   affect the interactions between the natives and either group of exotic
   grasses. In fact, the native perennial grasses that survived the first
   year of competition with annual grasses significantly reduced the
   aboveground productivity of annual grasses even without sawdust
   addition. These results suggest that the addition of sawdust as a tool
   in the restoration of native species in our system provided no
   significant benefit to natives over a 2-year period.}},

Abstract = {{In California's Mediterranean type grasslands, native perennial grasses
   such as Nassella pulchra are surrounded by introduced annual species and
   these annuals are thought to have displaced natives through much of
   their range. Amongst other invaders, two grasses Lolium multiflorum and
   Bromus hordeaceus, commonly dominate portions of the grassland with
   potential for N. pulchra restoration. We hypothesized that competitor
   species differences and small-scale gaps (150 cm(2)) could be important
   determinants of N. pulchra survival and performance on these sites.
   Lolium multiflorum and B. hordeaceus were planted in 20 cm diameter
   circular plots at a constant rate of 1 seed per cm(2) surrounding newly
   transplanted N. pulchra plants. Nassella pulchra showed no significant
   effect of the species of competitor or from the distribution of the
   competitors. Both interspersion of patches of bare ground and separation
   of competitors into patches did not increase N. pulchra pre-dawn water
   potential, basal area change, number of seeds produced, or average
   weight of seeds. The presence of L. multiflorum was associated with a
   decrease in N. pulchra survival compared with plots with only B.
   hordeaceus. Plants with increases in basal area of less than 0.75 cm(2)
   during the growing season had 74\% mortality compared with no mortality
   in plants with more growth. However, initial N. pulchra plant size was
   not a good predictor of mortality. Limiting competition from annuals may
   increase survival of N. pulchra plantings, but 60\% of the plants
   survived for at least 1 year, despite being transplanted into soil
   containing substantial annual grass seed.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is necessary for the regeneration of many native plant
   species, but can also facilitate biological invasions. As a result,
   disturbance can play complex roles in vulnerable habitats such as
   remnant Californian perennial grasslands. To investigate these
   conflicts, plots in a northern Californian coastal grassland were
   experimentally disturbed in the winter of 1990-1991; these plots
   differed in the area and intensity (depth) of the soil disturbance
   applied. When these plots were revisited after 10 growing seasons,
   patterns of revegetation differed significantly from those observed
   early in recolonization (0-3 years). At the earlier samplings, exotic
   annual grasses rapidly increased in most disturbance types. After 10
   years, these exotic annuals had retreated from the depth experiment,
   which had recovered to a vegetation dominated by native perennials in
   all but the most severely disturbed plots. In contrast, although
   differences between control and disturbed plots also disappeared in the
   area experiment, the average abundance of aliens did not decline
   substantially relative to 1993 levels, especially in larger
   disturbances. Nonetheless, populations of aliens remained small compared
   to the peak populations in the depth experiment, probably reflecting
   wetter soils at the site used for the area experiment. These results
   differ from those of other recent studies of soil disturbance in coastal
   Californian ecosystems, which indicate disturbance may result in the
   permanent replacement of native perennial vegetation by dense
   populations of exotic annual grasses. This difference may reflect the
   high resilience of northern coastal grasslands as well as the scale of
   disturbances considered by different studies.}},

Abstract = {{Invasion by exotic species is a major threat to global diversity.
   The,invasion of native perennial grasslands in California by annual
   species from the southern Mediterranean region is one of the most
   dramatic invasions worldwide. As a result of this invasion, native
   species are often restricted to low-fertility, marginal habitat. An
   understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the recolonization of the
   more fertile sites by native species is critical to determining the
   prospects for conservation and restoration of the native flora. We
   present the results of a five-year experiment in which we used seeding,
   burning, and mowing treatments to investigate the mechanisms that
   constrain native annuals to the marginal habitat of a Californian
   serpentine grassland. The abundance and richness of native species
   declined with increasing soil fertility, and there was no effect of
   burning or mowing on native abundance or richness in the absence of
   seeding. We found that native annual forbs were strongly seed limited; a
   single seeding increased abundance of native forbs even in the presence
   of high densities of exotic species, and this effect was generally
   discernable after four years. These results suggest that current levels
   of dominance by exotic species are not simply the result of direct
   competitive interactions, and that seeding of native species is
   necessary and may be sufficient to create viable populations of native
   annual species in areas that are currently dominated by exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{Species-rich grasslands that become enriched with nitrogen often suffer
   decreases in species richness, increases in plant biomass, and invasion
   by weedy exotic species. Suitable techniques to restore enriched
   grasslands and reestablish native communities are increasingly needed.
   Here we report results of a 5-yr experiment in enriched coastal prairie
   grasslands (Bodega Marine Reserve, Bodega Bay, California, USA), to
   determine the combined effects of mowing and biomass removal on total
   soil nitrogen, net rates of mineralization, nitrogen retention, and
   species richness and biomass. We mowed and removed plant biomass from
   plots in areas where the N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus),
   had greatly enriched the soil, and where the community was composed of
   weedy introduced plants. Our goal was to facilitate the establishment of
   the native grassland assemblage such as was found at nearby low soil
   nitrogen sites.
   Mowing and biomass removal resulted in a dramatic change in the species
   assemblage, from exotic annual grasses to a mixed exotic/native forb
   community composed primarily of perennials. Species richness was
   significantly greater in treated plots than in control plots weedy
   exotic grasses diminished in abundance, and both native and exotic forb
   species increased. In mowed vs. control plots, there was significantly
   less mean aboveground biomass, but significantly greater belowground
   biomass. This shift in species composition had significant impacts on
   nitrogen retention. In late fall and winter when plant-available N was
   highest, much nitrogen leached from the effectively fallow control plots
   where germination of annual grasses did not peak until midwinter. In
   contrast, mowed plots retained substantially greater amounts of
   nitrogen, due to the presence of perennial plants possessing large
   amounts of belowground biomass early in the season. Despite the
   cumulative removal of 22 g N/M-2 in biomass over 5 yr, there was no
   difference between mowed and control plots in total soil N, pool sizes
   of inorganic N, or net rates of N mineralization. The results indicate
   that removal of plant biomass by mowing shifted this plant community
   from an annual grass to a perennial forb assemblage. However, in doing
   so, N retention by vegetation was increased, making it more difficult to
   reduce soil N.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the rare annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora may be
   declining because of competitive suppression by exotic annual grasses,
   and may perform better in a matrix of native perennial bunchgrasses. We
   conducted a field competition experiment in which Amsinckia seedlings
   were transplanted into forty 0.64-m(2) experimental plots of exotic
   annual grassland or restored perennial grassland. The perennial
   grassland plots were restored using mature 3 cm-diameter plants of the
   native perennial bunchgrass Poa secunda planted in three densities. The
   exotic annual grassland plots were established in four densities through
   manual removal of existing plants. Both grass types reduced soil water
   potential with increasing biomass, but this reduction was not
   significantly different between grass types. Both grass types
   significantly reduced the production of Amsinckia inflorescences. At low
   and intermediate densities (dry biomass per unit area of 20-80 g/m(2)),
   the exotic annual grasses reduced Amsinckia inflorescence number to a
   greater extent than did Poa, although at high densities (>90 g/m(2))
   both grass types reduced the number of Amsinckia inflorescences to the
   same extent. The response of Amsinckia inflorescence number to Poa
   biomass was linear, whereas the same response to the annual grass
   biomass is logarithmic, and appeared to be related to graminoid cover.
   This may be because of the different growth forms exhibited by the two
   grass types. Results of this research suggest that restored native
   perennial grasslands at intermediate densities have a high habitat value
   for the potential establishment of the native annual A. grandiflora.}},

Abstract = {{In inland California grasslands, the high densities of alien annual
   species have altered the growing environment for native perennial
   grasses. Using variable-density plots, we measured the influence of
   intraspecific competition (conspecifics only) and diffuse competition
   (mixed-composition neighborhoods that include conspecifics) on growth
   and survival of Nassella pulchra, purple needlegrass. We assessed the
   effects of intraspecific and diffuse competition in weeded plots and
   unweeded plots, respectively, across a density gradient of N. pulchra
   plants (16-356 plants/m(2)). We used summer fire and spring sheep
   grazing to reduce diffuse competition in unweeded plots. The potential
   effect of rooting volume on competitive interactions was explored by
   establishing plots on two sites of different soil depth. Diffuse
   competition had an overriding influence on N. pulchra growth in all
   treatments. Intraspecific competitive effects were apparent only in the
   absence of diffuse competition. The effects of grazing and soil depth on
   growth were only short-lived interactions with the burning treatment.
   Burning was a longer-lived interaction, but only in weeded plots. Plant
   mortality was significantly increased by diffuse competition. Overall,
   N. pulchra survival was greatest in weeded plots, in grazed plots, and
   in deeper soil plots. The growth of N. pulchra individuals was
   negatively affected by alien annual species in all treatment
   combinations. Our data indicate that recruitment of N. pulchra within
   inland California grasslands is reduced by the adverse environment
   created by high densities of alien annual species. Successful attempts
   to increase populations of N. pulchra through management of the
   grassland community must involve significant modification of the biotic
   environment.}},
