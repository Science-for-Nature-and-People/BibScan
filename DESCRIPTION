Description: The package takes a folder with one or many .bib files, as could be downloaded from a Web of Science search. It uses the DOIs in those files to generate html links to PDFs and batch download those PDFs into a specified folder. It reports which papers did not have a PDF link and which were not able to be downloaded so users can download the remaining files by hand.
