abstract = {There is great interest in understanding how rangeland management practices affect the long-term sustainability of California oak woodland ecosystems through their influence on nutrient cycling. This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.{\&}A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability.},

abstract = {Empirical critical loads for N deposition effects and maps showing areas projected to be in exceedance of the critical load (CL) are given for seven major vegetation types in California. Thirty-five percent of the land area for these vegetation types (99,639km2) is estimated to be in excess of the N CL. Low CL values (3-8kgNha-1yr-1) were determined for mixed conifer forests, chaparral and oak woodlands due to highly N-sensitive biota (lichens) and N-poor or low biomass vegetation in the case of coastal sage scrub (CSS), annual grassland, and desert scrub vegetation. At these N deposition critical loads the latter three ecosystem types are at risk of major vegetation type change because N enrichment favors invasion by exotic annual grasses. Fifty-four and forty-four percent of the area for CSS and grasslands are in exceedance of the CL for invasive grasses, while 53 and 41{\%} of the chaparral and oak woodland areas are in exceedance of the CL for impacts on epiphytic lichen communities. Approximately 30{\%} of the desert (based on invasive grasses and increased fire risk) and mixed conifer forest (based on lichen community changes) areas are in exceedance of the CL. These ecosystems are generally located further from emissions sources than many grasslands or CSS areas. By comparison, only 3-15{\%} of the forested and chaparral land areas are estimated to be in exceedance of the NO3- leaching CL. The CL for incipient N saturation in mixed conifer forest catchments was 17kgNha-1yr-1. In 10{\%} of the CL exceedance areas for all seven vegetation types combined, the CL is exceeded by at least 10kgNha-1yr-1, and in 27{\%} of the exceedance areas the CL is exceeded by at least 5kgNha-1yr-1. Management strategies for mitigating the effects of excess N are based on reducing N emissions and reducing site N capital through approaches such as biomass removal and prescribed fire or control of invasive grasses by mowing, selective herbicides, weeding or domestic animal grazing. Ultimately, decreases in N deposition are needed for long-term ecosystem protection and sustainability, and this is the only strategy that will protect epiphytic lichen communities. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Understanding the impacts of livestock grazing on wildlands is important for making appropriate ecosystem management decisions. Using livestock exclosures, we examined the effects of moderate cattle grazing on the abundance of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyii Richardson) and the spatial distribution of active burrows within their colonies in grassland and blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook.{\&}Arn.) savanna habitats in the coastal range of California over a 3-year period (1991â€“ 1994). Overall, relative population densities of California ground squirrels declined significantly throughout the experiment, but did not differ between grazed and ungrazed colonies or between habitats. There was also no significant interaction between these 2 factors. The spatial distribution of burrows, as measured by the mean nearest neighbor distance of active entrances within a colony, did not differ significantly between grazed and ungrazed colonies or between habitats, nor was the interaction significant. Thus, low to moderate levels of cattle grazing did not appear to have a strong effect on the population dynamics of California ground squirrels, and grazing may be compatible with maintenance of ground squirrel populations. Based on multivariate analysis of variance of 1994 data, live plant cover, native plant cover, and standing biomass were lower where the number of burrows was higher on grazed colonies but were little affected on ungrazed colonies. Ground squirrels may increase the impact of livestock grazing and thus reduce the capacity of the land to support other activities. However, it is clear that the effects of livestock grazing are complex and that detailed studies of potential mechanisms by which grazing impacts California ground squirrel populations are necessary.},

resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass
cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native
forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years
maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion,

cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once
from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest
exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground.
P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn.
While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3
years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment.

ability of monocultures and diverse assemblages to resist invasion by an
exotic annual grass (cheatgrass) and an exotic biennial forb (dyer's

species. Soil NO3- and leaf-area index were examined as predictors of
invasive plant abundance. Cheatgrass invasion was greatest in forb and
shrub assemblages, and least in mixed grass or grass monoculture; dyer's
woad invasion was greatest into mixed grass or grass monoculture, but
least into monoculture or mixedspecies assemblages composed of forbs or
shrubs. The community composed of grasses, forbs, and shrubs suppressed
invasion by both species. Consequently, assemblages were most resistant
to invasion by species of the same growth form. Moreover, these
monocultures and mixtures were generally similar in conferring
resistance to invasion, but a monoculture of big sagebrush was more
resistant than a mixture of shrubs. Soil NO3- was correlated with
invasion by cheatgrass, whereas LAI was correlated with invasion by
dyer's woad, suggesting these species were more limited by belowground

killing of seedlings, is a common practice in agricultural and
prerestoration settings, but its application for post-restoration
management has not been tested in the context of restored native plants.
Summer watering at already restored sites could reduce exotic annual
grass cover by decreasing the seed bank, thereby increasing native
perennial success in subsequent growing seasons. Five replicated
watering treatments of 11.35 L per watering event were applied for up to
a 4 week period, with watering events ranging from once daily for a
minimum or four and maximum of 16 d, or twice daily for 4 d, for a total
of 45.4-181.7 L water applied in each 1-m(2) plot. Two of the watering
treatments triggered significant flushing of annual grasses: watering
for a total of 16 d once per day, and 4 d twice per day. Although this
conferred a short-term reduction in annual grass emergence at the start
of the subsequent rainy season, it did not reduce total annual cover at
peak flowering in the growing season, or provide a longer term advantage
to native perennial grasses. It is possible that there are sufficient
seeds in the seed bank that this at least partly compensated for the
seed bank reduction and did not result in a reduction in final cover, or
that lower densities of seedlings are sufficient to achieve ``total{\{}''{\}}
cover. Perennial grass cover increased in response to all watering
treatments, but this did not result in significantly increased cover the
following year. These results suggest that even watering treatments that
produce large flushes of exotic annual grasses are insufficient to
reduce exotic cover longer term. It should be explored whether more
water, applied more frequently, could be effective in reducing the
exotic grass seed bank enough to confer a long-term reduction in exotic
cover and a benefit to native perennial grasses.},

The,invasion of native perennial grasslands in California by annual
species from the southern Mediterranean region is one of the most
dramatic invasions worldwide. As a result of this invasion, native
species are often restricted to low-fertility, marginal habitat. An
understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the recolonization of the
more fertile sites by native species is critical to determining the
prospects for conservation and restoration of the native flora. We
present the results of a five-year experiment in which we used seeding,
burning, and mowing treatments to investigate the mechanisms that
constrain native annuals to the marginal habitat of a Californian
serpentine grassland. The abundance and richness of native species
declined with increasing soil fertility, and there was no effect of
burning or mowing on native abundance or richness in the absence of
seeding. We found that native annual forbs were strongly seed limited; a
single seeding increased abundance of native forbs even in the presence
of high densities of exotic species, and this effect was generally
discernable after four years. These results suggest that current levels
of dominance by exotic species are not simply the result of direct
competitive interactions, and that seeding of native species is
necessary and may be sufficient to create viable populations of native
annual species in areas that are currently dominated by exotic species.},

addition, field experiments were conducted at three sites in northern
California (Yuba, Yolo, and Lassen counties) and one in southern Oregon

showed enhanced weed control when applied following disturbance. Rates
as low as 70 g/ha, if combined with thatch removal, provided significant
suppression of medusahead. In addition, disturbance alone generally

abstract = {Restoration of California native perennial grassland is often initiated
with cultivation to reduce the density and cover of non-native annual
grasses before seeding with native perennials. Tillage is known to
adversely impact agriculturally cultivated land; thus changes in soil
biological functions, as indicated by carbon (C) turnover and C
retention, may also be negatively affected by these restoration
techniques. We investigated a restored perennial grassland in the fourth
year after planting Nassella pulchra, Elymus glaucus, and Hordeum
brachyantherum ssp. californicum for total soil C and nitrogen (N),
microbial biomass C, microbial respiration, CO2 concentrations in the
soil atmosphere, surface efflux of CO2, and root distribution (0- to
15-, 15- to 30-, 30- to 60-, and 60- to 80-cm depths). A comparison was
made between untreated annual grassland and plots without plant cover
still maintained by tillage and herbicide. In the uppermost layer (0- to
15-cm depth), total C, microbial biomass C, and respiration were lower
in the tilled, bare soil than in the grassland soils, as was CO2 efflux
from the soil surface. Root length near perennial bunchgrasses was lower
at the surface and greater at lower depths than in the annual
grass-dominated areas; a similar but less pronounced trend was observed
for root biomass. Few differences in soil biological or chemical
properties occurred below 15-cm depth, except that at lower depths, the
CO2 concentration in the soil atmosphere was lower in the plots without
vegetation, possibly from reduced production of CO2 due to the lack of
root respiration. Similar microbiological properties in soil layers
below 15-cm depth suggest that deeper microbiota rely on more
recalcitrant C sources and are less affected by plant removal than in
the surface layer, even after 6 years. Without primary production,
restoration procedures with extended periods of tillage and herbicide
applications led to net losses of C during the plant-free periods.
However, at 4 years after planting native grasses, soil microbial
biomass and activity were nearly the same as the former conditions
represented by annual grassland, suggesting high resilience to the
temporary disturbance caused by tillage.},

abstract = {1. Ecological invasions are often associated with persistent changes to
underlying ecological processes. Restoration of invaded communities is
dependent on manipulation of these processes to favour the target
species composition and impart resistance to further invasion. We
applied these principles to extensively degraded grassy woodlands in
temperate agricultural regions of Australia, where widespread invasion
by mediterranean annuals is related to altered ecological processes such
as soil nutrient cycling.
2. We investigated carbon supplementation and spring burns, in
association with re-establishment of native perennial grasses, as
potential management tools for manipulating nitrogen cycling, soil seed
banks and establishment conditions in degraded woodland understoreys.
Through these mechanisms we aimed to enhance native cover and increase
resistance to invasion by exotic annuals.
3. In two contrasting degraded remnants, repeated sucrose applications
temporarily reduced soil nitrate to inferred pre-European levels, which
dramatically reduced growth of exotic annuals and enhanced native
perennial abundance. Repeated spring burns did not reduce soil nitrate
but reduced exotic annual grasses through effects on soil seed banks
and/or establishment conditions.
4. Spring burns and carbon supplements both significantly enhanced
establishment of Themeda australis, a dominant tussock grass prior to
European settlement. Combinations of T. australis seed addition and
either spring burning or carbon supplements enhanced native plant
abundance more effectively than treatments without seed addition.
5. Within 18 months of their establishment, T. australis seedlings
significantly reduced soil nitrate in some treatments, providing a
preliminary indication that re-establishment of a dense sward of this
species may restore ecosystem function to a low-nitrate state that
favours native perennials over exotic annuals.
6. Synthesis and applications. Ecological restoration can be viewed as
targeted intervention in species-environment interactions, whereby
ecological conditions are manipulated to enhance establishment or vigour
of key species, and these species in turn help restore ecological
processes that favour the target species composition. In grassy
ecosystems re-establishing a perennial sward of appropriate native
tussock grasses may be critical for restoring pre-disturbance nitrogen
cycles and improving resistance to invasion by exotic annuals. Carbon
supplements and spring burns facilitate this process through
complementary mechanisms.},

of contemporary drivers and historical legacies that are both biotic and

contingency, we manipulated (i) competition with exotic annual grasses,
(ii) the timing of this competition (temporal priority in
arrival/seeding times) and (iii) watering (simulated rainfall) in a
restoration-style planting of native perennial grasses. In addition, we
replicated this experiment simultaneously at three sites in
north-central California. Native perennial grasses had 73-99 {\%} less
cover when planted with exotic annuals than when planted alone, but this
reduction was greatly ameliorated by planting the natives 2 weeks prior
to the exotics. In a drought year, irrigation significantly reduced
benefits of early planting so that these benefits resembled those
observed in a non-drought year. There were significant differences
across the three sites (site effects and interactions) in (i) overall
native cover, (ii) the response of natives to competition, (iii) the
strength of the temporal priority effect and (iv) the degree to which
supplemental watering reduced priority effects. These results reveal the

implications for a wide range of ecosystem services. Medusahead invasion
reduces biodiversity, wildlife habitat and forage production, and often

The last review of medusahead ecology and management was completed 20

medusahead management suggesting a significant need to develop an
up-to-date synthesis. Medusahead continues to pose a serious threat to
rangeland ecosystems. In this synthesis, we present new information

medusahead based on invasion level, and identify research needs to
further improve management of this invasive annual grass. Success of
different management practices varies between the Intermountain West and
California Annual Grasslands, signifying that the best management
practices are those specifically tailored with consideration of climate,
soil, plant community characteristics, and management objectives.

abstract = {For many years, the San Joaquin River (SJR) has had low dissolved oxygen
conditions intermittently during the late summer and early fall. The low
dissolved oxygen conditions are impacting critical fish habitat and the
SJR is being regulated under a state of California remediation plan that
includes the development of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocation
for oxygen demanding substances. In support of the development of a
scientific TMDL allocation, studies are being conducted to characterize
water quality in the many tributaries of the SJR. This study identified
the sources of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in two western
tributaries of the SJR, Mud Slough and Salt Slough, and measured the
loads of BOD, algae, and ammonia entering the SJR from wetland and
agricultural sources.
Mud and Salt Sloughs drain the Grassland Watershed. The watershed
contains seasonal wetlands, irrigated farmland, and other agricultural
lands. This drainage is under close regulatory scrutiny, because it
produces a majority of the selenium and boron entering the SJR. In this
study, wetland and irrigated agricultural drainage were sampled
separately and a comparison was made to determine differences in water
quality. In addition, water entering the study area was compared to
water exiting the study area to determine the effect of water use in the
region on water quality.
This study demonstrated that BOD loads from the Grassland Watershed to
the SJR were proportional to flow during June-October, the most critical
time for dissolved oxygen deficits in the lower SJR. This indicates that
Mud and Salt Sloughs are not producing more BOD than other tributaries
in the region that are not under close regulatory scrutiny. The BOD
concentration of wetland drainage is higher than that of agricultural
drainage, but the higher agricultural drainage flows result in a higher
mass loading of BOD. Wetland flooding and irrigation of crops both had a
negative impact on water quality. Algal growth was identified as the
major source of BOD in agricultural drainage and locations where BOD
control could potentially be implemented were identified. (C) 2007

abstract = {Resolving the spatial and temporal dynamics of gross primary
productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems across different scales
remains a challenge. Remote sensing is regarded as the solution to
upscale point observations conducted at the ecosystem level, using the
eddy covariance (EC) technique, to the landscape and global levels. In
addition to traditional vegetation indices, the photochemical
reflectance index (PRI) and the emission of solar-induced chlorophyll
fluorescence (SIF), now measurable from space, provide a new range of
opportunities to monitor the global carbon cycle using remote sensing.
However, the scale mismatch between EC observations and the much coarser
satellite-derived data complicate the integration of the two sources of
data. The solution is to establish a network of in situ spectral
measurements that can act as a bridge between EC measurements and
remote-sensing data. In situ spectral measurements have already been
conducted for many years at EC sites, but using variable
instrumentation, setups, and measurement standards. In Europe in
particular, in situ spectral measurements remain highly heterogeneous.
The goal of EUROSPEC Cost Action ES0930 was to promote the development
of common measuring protocols and new instruments towards establishing
best practices and standardization of these measurements. In this review
we describe the background and main tradeoffs of in situ spectral
measurements, review the main results of EUROSPEC Cost Action, and
discuss the future challenges and opportunities of in situ spectral

total N additions and offset 75-100{\%} of soil C sequestration. All

was to determine intake, botanical composition of intake, and
nutritional quality of diets of sheep and goats browsing California
chaparral during fall, spring and summer.
Woody plants constituted 93.3{\%}, 87.0{\%}, and 88.8{\%} of the diet of
goats, and 93.7{\%}, 67.1{\%}, and 82.7{\%} of the diet of sheep in fall,

when available. For browse, sheep preferred oak species in fall, whereas
in summer they preferred Adenostoma fasciculatum (chamise). Goats
exhibited a similar species preference ranking, but with significant
differences in proportions. Seasonal variations in intake proportions
only partially reflected differences in nutritional quality. It is
likely that seasonal variation in secondary compound concentration as
well as available choice, in particular available herbaceous biomass,
are important factors driving intake and diet composition. Organic
matter digestibility of the consumed diets varied from 55.8{\%} in fall to
61.9{\%} in spring for goats and from 44.1{\%} in fall to 56.8{\%} in spring
for sheep. Daily DM intake (g kg BW-0.75) was lowest (P {\textless} 0.05) in
summer for goats and sheep but highest (P {\textless} 0.05) in fall for goats and
in spring for sheep. Crude protein (g kg BW-0.75) and ME (MJ kg BW-0.75)
intakes were lowest (P {\textless} 0.05) in fall for goats and in summer for sheep

weight throughout all seasons but sheep lost relatively more weight (P {\textless}

1999. Of the sampling sites, 2 received high nutrient runoff from
agricultural fields and other non-point sources, and 3 received runoff
from grasslands and woodlands. The diversity of ammonia-oxidizing
bacteria in terms of DNA sequences was investigated at 3 of the sites in
August 1998. Both 16S and amoA sequences from sediment samples were more
closely related to those of Nitrosomonas marina than to any other
cultured nitrifier, but there was considerable diversity within the
group, and site-specific patterns were not detected. Potential
nitrification was seasonally and spatially variable, with the highest
rates occurring at the head of Elkhorn Slough in late winter and fall.
Bacterial productivity was highest during the summer and generally
higher at a site adjacent to grasslands compared to the 2 agricultural
sites. The variability in nitrification rates was not directly
correlated with hydrographic and environmental variables. Physical
factors may affect nitrification rates indirectly by controlling
salinity and bottom-water oxygen concentrations. Potential nitrification
rates were positively correlated with pore water NH4+ concentrations
under well flushed conditions but were negligible in the presence of
high NH4+ concentrations under poorly flushed conditions, due to low
oxygen availability, hypersaline conditions or both. Sediment nitrogen
budgets for 3 of the sites suggested that denitrification removed about
25 {\%} of the mineralized nitrogen at the poorly flushed site, but 50 {\%}
or more at well flushed sites. Poorly flushed systems appear to be less
efficient at removing high nitrogen inputs than well flushed systems
because of the low rates of coupled nitrification-denitrification in the
former, implying that physical factors such as the flushing regime or
residence time can significantly affect nitrogen removal by
denitrification.},

individual habitats to rare plant conservation by integrating analyses
on overall diversity, species per area, specificity-weighted richness,
presence of hotspots, and the composition of the rare plant community in
each habitat type. This combination of analyses allowed us to determine
which habitats are most significant for rare plant conservation at a
local scale. Our analyses indicated that several habitat types were
consistently associated with rare plant species. In broad terms,
grasslands, oak forests, coniferous forests, wetlands, serpentines,
chaparral, and rock outcrops were most consistently highlighted. No
single habitat stood out in every analysis however, and therefore we
conclude that careful selection of an assemblage of habitats that best
represents diverse, restricted and unique rare plant communities will be
the most efficient approach to protecting rare plant habitat at local

spite of significant annual uptake and release by plant growth and
dieback, exhibits only moderate seasonal fluctuations reflecting strong
buffering from labile biogenic Si, dominated by phytoliths and by
secondary pedogenic silicates. Long phytolith residence times (340-900
yrs) reflect the seasonally dry climate and high solute Si
concentrations. Water-extractable Si is closely associated with Al,
indicating seasonal precipitation and dissolution of a highly labile 1:
1 hydroxyaluminosilicate (HAS), probably allophane, which transforms in
deeper soil into fine grained, poorly crystalline kaolinite. Shallow
plant roots extract greater proportions of biogenic Si and deeper plant
roots larger amounts pedogenic Si.
High pore water Ge/Si in late winter and spring reflects the reinforcing
effects of plant fractionation and concurrent dissolution of Ge-enriched
HAS. The same processes produce pore waters with depleted Si-30/Si-28.
In the summer and fall, Ge/Si declines and Si-30/Si-28 increases,
reflecting the cessation of plant uptake, continued dissolution of soil
phytoliths and re-precipitation of less soluble HAS. Si inputs from
weathering (2-90 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) and losses from pore water discharge
(18-68 mM m(-2) yr(-1)) are comparable for individual soils, decline
with soil age and are significantly less than amounts of Si annual
cycled through the vegetation (42-171 mM m(-2) yr(-1)). Mobile Si is
generally balanced in the soils with upward bio-pumping by the
shallow-rooted grasses efficiently competing against downward leaching

VIIRS 375 m data proved to have higher sensitivity to small fires and
higher fire detection rates compared to previous studies, indicating

Management of nitrogen (N) inputs to the degraded substrates is
difficult because the low level of ambient fertility on disturbed
substrates requires large total N inputs to sustain revegetative growth,
but it also requires low N bioavailability in order to avoid weedy
invasion and eutrophication of local watersheds. Commonly available soil
amendment materials have a wide variety of N contents and release rates,
making specification of appropriate N amendments difficult. We compared
N release rates of a variety of organic-based soil amendments and
chemical fertilizers in long-term aerobic incubation chambers in the lab
and at a field revegetation site. The N release rate from these
amendments fell into four general groups: (1) rapid N release from
soluble chemical fertilizer formulations, (2) longer, controlled N
release from chemical-based, slow-release formulations, and a two-phase
release pattern (rapid initial phase, slower second phase) from (3)
organic-based blends, as well as (4) unsupplemented municipal yard-waste
composts. The release rates from organic-based amendments were about
three times faster in the 30 degrees C laboratory incubations than in
the cool, moist winter growing season at a field site in the Central
Valley of California. Relative rates of N release can be compared
between amendment materials to help guide selection of N amendments,
according to the plant-growth goals of the revegetation project.

abstract = {Vegetation-type conversions between grasslands and shrublands have
occurred worldwide in semiarid regions over the last 150 years. Areas
once covered by drought-deciduous shrubs in Southern California (coastal
sage scrub) are converting to grasslands dominated by nonnative species.
Increasing fire frequency, drought, and nitrogen deposition have all
been hypothesized as causes of this conversion, though there is little
direct evidence. We constructed rain-out shelters in a coastal sage
scrub community following a wildfire, manipulated water and nitrogen
input in a split-plot design, and collected annual data on community
composition for four years. While shrub cover increased through time in
all plots during the postfire succession, both drought and nitrogen
significantly slowed recovery. Four years after the fire, average native
shrub cover ranged from over 80{\%} in water addition, ambient-nitrogen
plots to 20{\%} in water reduction, nitrogen addition plots. Nonnative
grass cover was high following the fire and remained high in the water
reduction plots through the third spring after the fire, before
decreasing in the fourth year of the study. Adding nitrogen decreased
the cover of native plants and increased the cover of nonnative grasses,
but also increased the growth of one crown-sprouting shrub species. Our
results suggest that extreme drought during postfire succession may slow

each other, leading to a continued decline of native shrubs and

exotic species diversity in many grasslands, yet both of these
disturbances have notoriously variable effects. Few studies have
examined how landscape-level heterogeneity in grassland characteristics,
such as soil-based variation in biomass and species composition, may
contribute to variation in the effects of fire or grazing. We studied
the effects of livestock grazing and fire in a mosaic of serpentine and
nonserpentine soils in California, where most grasslands are dominated
by exotic annuals and serpentine soil is the major refuge for native
grassland species. We predicted that the effects of disturbance would be
proportional to productivity and therefore would be greater on
nonserpentine than serpentine soils. We measured species composition at
80-100 grazed or ungrazed sites for 2 years before (1998-1999) and 2
years after (2000-2001) an autumn wildfire. Both disturbances increased
total species richness on both soils. However, fire enhanced total and
exotic species richness more on nonserpentine soils and enhanced native
species richness more on serpentine soils. Grazing increased native
species richness on serpentine soils but not on nonserpentine soils.
These soil-disturbance interactions suggest that the use of fire and
grazing to manage native species diversity in wildlands must be done
with careful attention to background ecological heterogeneity.},

amendment over 4yr on plant dynamics in two grazed grassland ecosystems
in California: a coastal prairie and valley grassland. The valley
grassland was dominated by exotic annual grasses and had significantly
lower species diversity than the coastal prairie, which consisted of a
mix of perennial and annual grasses and forbs. We observed large and
persistent increases in aboveground biomass. Over the 4 study years,
aboveground biomass from compost-amended plots increased by 76{\%}+/- 21{\%}
at the valley grassland and 41{\%}+/- 21{\%} at the coastal prairie,
compared with controls. Plant N content was also greater from
compost-amended plots. There were no major shifts in species richness or
abundance at either grassland site. Overall, plant communities at both
grasslands were relatively resistant to the compost addition, but
responses of some individual species were observed. Notably at the
valley grassland, the abundance of forbs decreased slightly, while the
abundance of grasses increased. The abundance of two noxious weeds did
not change as a result of the compost amendment. Our results suggest
that a single application of composted organic matter used to sequester

resources can increase invasion by non-native plants into natural
communities. One possible explanation is that the ability of natives to
compete with non-natives tends to decrease when resource availability is
increased. We tested this hypothesis in a competition experiment using
two closely matched plant species and two environmental factors related
to limiting resources in a coastal grassland system on Bodega Head in
northern California. We grew the native grass Bromus carinatus and the
non-native grass B. diandrus together and apart at different levels of
soil nitrogen crossed with different levels of soil salinity. Both
species are abundant in the grassland and previous work suggested that
the abundance of B. carinatus is lower and the abundance of B. diandrus
is higher on soil that has been enriched with nitrogen. Salinity has
been shown to be negatively associated with invasion by B. diandrus into
another California grassland, and to vary significantly over short
distances in the grassland at Bodega Head, where it could affect water
availability, which strongly limits plant growth during the dry season.
Contrary to our prediction that low resource availabilities would
increase the relative competitive ability of the native, the ability of
B. carinatus to compete with B. diandrus was not greater when nitrogen
availability was lower or when soil salinity was higher. Instead, high
salinity increased the relative competitive ability of the non-native,

preventing resource enrichment will not suffice to control invasion by
non-native plant species in this grassland.},

abstract = {Ecosystem ecologists traditionally have focused their attention on
direct interactions among species, particularly those interactions that
control flows of energy and materials among trophic levels. Emerging
evidence suggests that indirect interactions may be more important than
direct ones in determining ecosystem patterns and processes. Here I
review indirect effects of ungulates on nutrient cycling, net primary
production, and disturbance regimes in terrestrial ecosystems. Ungulates
influence the nitrogen (N) cycle by changing litter quality, thereby
affecting conditions for N mineralization, and by adding readily
available N to upper levels of the soil in urine and feces. As a result
of these additions, natural heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of
N within landscapes is amplified by ungulate selection of habitats and
patches. The magnitude of returns of plant N to the soil in urine and
feces is a function of animal body mass and characteristics of the diet,
particularly N content and levels of tannin. Effects on N cycling can
cascade throughout the ecosystem, and can stabilize or destabilize the
composition of plant communities. Net primary production can increase or
decline in response to ungulate grazing. The direction of this response
depends on the intensity of grazing or browsing, the evolutionary
history of the ecosystem, and the opportunity for regrowth. Opportunity
for regrowth is determined by physiological and morphological
characteristics of the plant as well as environmental conditions,
particularly the extent and timing of moisture availability. Ungulates
influence fire regimes by altering the quality and quantity of fuels
available for combustion. In grasslands, ungulates often reduce the
extent, frequency, and intensity of fires, while in shrublands and
forests, their effects can increase the likelihood of crown fires, while
reducing the likelihood of surface fires. I develop the case that the
way that ungulates influence ecosystem process is contingent on
historical context, in particular the long-term context provided by
plant-animal coevolution and soil development and the short-term context
created by climate and weather. I show that ungulates are important
agents of change in ecosystems, acting to create spatial heterogeneity,
modulate successional processes, and control the switching of ecosystems

species composition in montane vernal pools? Which grazing and
precipitation variables best predict cover of vernal pool specialists
and species with broader habitat requirements? Is vernal pool species
diversity correlated with livestock exclosure, and at what spatial
scales?
Location: Montane vernal pools, northeast California, USA.
Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 20 vernal pools, including pools
where livestock had been excluded for up to 20years We compared plant
species composition, functional group composition and species diversity
among sites that varied in grazing history and seasonal precipitation
using CCA and LMM.
Results: Although vernal pool specialists were dominant in montane
vernal pools, over a third of plant cover was comprised of species that
occur over a broad range of wetland or upland environments. The species
composition of vernal pool plant communities was influenced by both
livestock grazing and precipitation patterns, however the relative
effects of these environmental variables differed by functional group.
Livestock exclosures favoured perennial vernal pool specialists over
annual vernal pool specialists. In contrast, the cover of habitat
generalists was more strongly influenced by seasonal precipitation than
livestock grazing. At small spatial scales, species richness and
diversity decreased as the number of years a pool had been fenced
increased, but this relationship was not significant at a larger spatial
scale.
Conclusions: Both livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure
the montane vernal pool plant community. We found that livestock grazing
promotes the cover of annual vernal pool specialists, but at the expense
of perennial vernal pool specialists. Wetter vernal pools, however,
support higher cover of wetland generalist species regardless of whether
pools are grazed.},

Shorter E. coli time series data sets (on the order of 10 days or less)

grazed field. Nematode communities, phospholipid fatty acid (PISA)
biomarkers, and soil properties (NH4+-N, NO3--N, total N, total C, pH,
P. bulk density and soil texture) were measured, and riparian health
ratings were scored. Environmental variables were obtained from
publicly-available data sources (slope, elevation, available water
capacity, erodability, hydraulic conductivity, exchangeable cation
capacity, organic matter, clay and sand content and pH).
The abundance and richness in most food web components were higher in
grazed grasslands than in intensive agricultural fields. Consumers
contributed less than their resources to the abundance and richness of
the community in all channels. The association between richness and
abundance for each component was strongest for the lowest trophic links
(microbes, as inferred by PLEA) and weakest for the highest (predatory

herbivore channels were greater in the grassland than in the cropland.
Fields for crops or grazing supported more interactions than the water's
edge in the plant herbivore and microbivore channels. Connectance
increased with the total richness of each community. Higher connectance
within the microbivore and predator prey soil food web channels were
associated with soil NO3--N and elevation respectively, which served as
surrogate indicators of high and low agricultural intensification. (C)

eroded C (e.g., sequestration or oxidation) may affect the global C
budget, and delivery of N and P to waterbodies can lead to
eutrophication. Whereas the magnitude of particulate nutrient losses may
be similar to or greater than dissolved losses, it is rarely estimated.
We couple a sediment delivery model with measurements of C, N, and P in
soil to account explicitly for hillslope sediment transport processes
that yield sediment-bound nutrients to fluvial networks. The model is
applied to a site in California dominated by coastal sage scrub and
gopher-rich grasslands. Although the magnitude of sediment delivery
predicted by the model has been tested with reservoir sedimentation
records, no data exist to test the predicted rates of nutrient delivery.
Nevertheless, the model results are provocative; it predicts that losses
of particulate C from sage covered hillslopes (23 kg/ha/yr) are nearly
double that from grassland hillslopes (13 kg/ha/yr), despite a lower
annual sediment yield from the sage hillslopes. The model predicts
similar average annual N and P losses for sage and grasslands but
dramatic differences in the frequency and magnitude of delivery events.
Nutrient delivery from grasslands is chronic whereas delivery from the
coastal sage is highly episodic, with large pulses driven by fire
frequency. These results suggest that changes in the vegetation

of California's forests, shrublands, and grasslands. Simulation results
indicate that during 1951-2000, the net primary productivity (NPP)
increased by 7{\%}, from 72.2 to 77.1 Tg C yr(-1) (1 teragram = 10(12) g),
mainly due to CO2 fertilization, since the climate hardly changed during
this period. Similarly, heterotrophic respiration increased by 5{\%}, from
69.4 to 73.1 Tg Cyr(-1), mainly due to increased forest soil carbon and
temperature. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly variable in the
50-year period but on average equalled 3.0 Tg C yr(-1) (total of 149 Tg
C). As with NEP, the net biome production (NBP) was also highly variable
but averaged -0.55 Tg C yr(-1) (total of -27.3 Tg C) because NBP in the
1980s was very low (-5.34 Tg C yr(-1)). During the study period, a total
of 126 Tg carbon were removed by logging and land use change, and 50 Tg
carbon were directly removed by wildland fires. For carbon pools, the
estimated total living upper canopy (tree) biomass decreased from 928 to
834 Tg C, and the understory (including shrub and grass) biomass
increased from 59 to 63 Tg C. Soil carbon and dead biomass carbon
increased from 1136 to 1197 Tg C.
Our analyses suggest that both natural and human processes have
significant influence on the carbon change in California. During
1951-2000, climate interannual variability was the key driving force for
the large interannual changes of ecosystem carbon source and sink at the
state level, while logging and fire were the dominant driving forces for
carbon balances in several specific ecoregions. From a long-term
perspective. CO2 fertilization plays a key role in maintaining higher
NPP. However, our study shows that the increase in C sequestration by
CO2 fertilization is largely offset by logging/land use change and
wildland fires. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is currently no consensus on how physical and biological factors
affect competitive intensity. Tests of whether competitive intensity
varies along axes of environmental change have commonly been conducted
in systems with a single strong environmental gradient, such as
productivity, a soil resource, or an environmental stress. Frequently,
these same axes are associated with changes in species composition, yet
few studies have asked whether shifts in the identity of competitors
affect competitive intensity. We ask whether resources ( nutrients,
water), stressors ( heavy metals, Ca:Mg ratio), productivity (
aboveground biomass), or species identity ( an ordination axis of plant
community composition) were the best predictors of the intensity of
competition in a heterogeneous grassland landscape that included
multiple independent environmental gradients. The reproductive fitness
of six annual plant species was measured in the presence and absence of
competitors and used to calculate relative interaction intensity (RII).
We found that RII was best predicted by community composition. Nutrient
availability was also important, and a post hoc test showed that
competitive intensity was best explained by the combined effects of
community composition and nutrient availability. We argue that community
composition may be the most effective metric for predicting competitive
intensity in many ecosystems because it includes both the competitive
effects of the local community and information about covarying
environmental characteristics.},

effects of cutting on vegetative buffer uptake of NO3--N based on the
theory that regular cutting would increase N demand and sequestration by
encouraging new plant growth. During the summer of 2002, 10 buffer plots
were established within a flood-irrigated pasture. In 2003, IN-labeled
KNO3 was applied to the pasture area at a rate of 5 kg N ha(-1) and 99.7
atom {\%} N-15. One-half of the buffer plots were trimmed monthly. In the
buffers, the cutting effect was not significant in the first few weeks
following IN application, with both the cut and uncut buffers
sequestering `IN. Over the irrigation season, however, cut buffers
sequestered 2.3 times the N-15 of uncut buffers, corresponding to an
increase in aboveground biomass following cutting. Cutting and removing
vegetation allowed the standing biomass to take advantage of soil `IN as
it was released by microbial mineralization. In contrast, the uncut
buffers showed very little change in N-15 sequestration or biomass,
suggesting senescence and a corresponding decrease in N demand. Overall,
cutting significantly improved N-15 attenuation from both surface and
subsurface water. However, the effect was temporally related, and only
became significant 21 to 42d after IN application. The dominant
influence on runoff water quality from irrigated pasture remains
irrigation rate, as reducing the rate by 75{\%} relative to the typical
rate resulted in a 50{\%} decrease in total runoff losses and a sevenfold

warmer surface temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. At
the same time, reactive nitrogen is entering natural systems at
unprecedented rates. These global environmental changes have
consequences for the functioning of natural ecosystems, and responses of
these systems may feed back to affect climate and atmospheric

exposed to factorial combinations of four expected global environmental
changes. We exposed California grassland to elevated CO2, temperature,
precipitation, and nitrogen deposition for five years. Root and shoot
production did not respond to elevated CO2 or modest warming.
Supplemental precipitation led to increases in shoot production and
offsetting decreases in root production. Supplemental nitrate deposition
increased total production by an average of 26{\%}, primarily by
stimulating shoot growth. Interactions among the main treatments were
rare. Together, these results suggest that production in this grassland
will respond minimally to changes in CO2 and winter precipitation, and
to small amounts of warming. Increased nitrate deposition would have
stronger effects on the grassland. Aside from this nitrate response,
expectations that a changing atmosphere and climate would promote carbon
storage by increasing plant growth appear unlikely to be realized in
this system.},

effective at reducing starthistle biomass and seedbank: mowing alone
reduced biomass 92 +/- 2{\%}, mowing with thatch removal 91 +/- 1{\%}, and
mowing with solarization 95 +/- 1{\%}. Compared to seedbank sizes in the

improved perennial species' biomass. Annual species' biomass varied on a
year-to-year basis but was not significantly affected by any treatment.
Seedbank sizes of annuals and perennials also did not differ according

consuming older SOC to utilizing easily degraded rhizodeposits derived
from increased root biomass. In contrast to this increased retention of
stabilized older SOC under elevated CO2. movement of newly fixed carbon
from roots to stabilized SOC pools was retarded; though root biomass
increased under elevated CO2, new carbon in mineral-bound pools

The study area contains strong gradients in environmental conditions and

NDVI, or 0th-order harmonic, indicated overall productivity, allowing
the differentiation of unproductive, moderately productive, and highly
productive sites. The amplitude of the first harmonic indicated the
variability of productivity over the year as expressed in a single
annual pulse of net primary production. This summarized the relative
dominance of evergreen vs. deciduous or annual habit. The phase of the
first harmonic summarized the timing of green-up relative to the timing
of winter and spring rains. This differentiated rapidly responding
annual grasslands, slowly responding evergreen life-forms, and irrigated
agriculture. The second harmonic indicated the strength and timing of
any biannual signal. This provided information on secondary vegetation

abstract = {Worldwide, anthropogenic disturbance has contributed to reductions in
native earthworm abundance and diversity and subsequent establishment of
exotic populations. Exotic earthworm species dominate the earthworm
community primarily in nutrient-enriched soils characteristic of
urbanized and rural areas, while native species persist in less
disturbed habitat. We hypothesized that exotic species may displace
native species through competitive interactions, but only under
conditions of high resource availability. To test this we manipulated
both grassland productivity and the presence and density of intra- and
interspecific competitors in field and laboratory experiments with two
common species, the native megascolecid Argilophilus marmoratus Eisen
1893 and the exotic lumbricid Aporrectodea trapezoides Duges 1828.
Overall, Ap. trapezoides maintained greater relative growth than Ar.
marmoratus. The difference in growth between the two species declined
with decreasing habitat quality, primarily due to lower relative growth
of Ap. trapezoides in less productive grasslands. As the competitor
species, Ap. trapezoides had a negative effect on both itself and Ar
marmoratus in all habitat types, while At. marmoratus as competitor had
a more neutral effect. Reproductive development followed the same
general pattern, but to become reproductive Ap. trapezoides required
almost double the amount of relative growth as Ar marmoratus. Both
species had a negative effect on potential food resources, including
microbial biomass and belowground plant biomass, but Ap. trapezoides
reduced resources more than Ar marmoratus in all habitat types. Ap.
trapezoides achieved a greater relative growth than Ar marmoratus in
soils with high resource availability, but it lost proportionally more
mass as resources declined. Thus, Ap. trapezoides attempting to colonize
less productive grasslands may simply deplete available resources and
fail to achieve sufficient growth for reproductive development. Our
results suggest that interspecific competition has the potential to
prevent At. marmoratus from recolonizing pastures dominated by Ap.
trapezoides. Both species respond to enhanced resources in these
pastures, but in resource-rich habitats Ap. trapezoides may exclude Ar
marmoratus through greater and faster growth per unit resource
consumption coupled with earlier onset of reproduction. Ar marmoratus is
the weaker competitor of the two, but its negative effect on Ap.
trapezoides in less productive grassland may exacerbate the role of
resource limitation in preventing Ap. trapezoides from expanding its
range. (0 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

longer-term losses of soil carbon under conditions of extended seasonal
rainfall. The repeated recovery of fungal diversity and abundance during
periodic drought events suggests that species with a wide range of
environmental tolerances coexist in this community, consistent with a
storage effect in soil fungi. Increased diversity during dry periods
further suggests that drought stress moderates competition among fungal

Nevski) poses a substantial threat to the health and function of
rangelands across the western United States. On rangelands containing
other desirable annual grasses, selective control of medusahead is
difficult as this invasive species has traits similar to those of
desired species. One key trait that differs between medusahead and other
annual grasses is the rate and timing of phenological development. In
this study we define management states for medusahead on the basis of
the patterns of variation of forage palatability and susceptibility of
seed production to defoliation over phenological stages. We integrate
these management states with field observations to model the rates and
timing of phenology-based management states to identify when targeted
grazing or mowing treatments are most appropriate using Dirichlet
regression and multistate modeling. While defoliation at any
phenological stage from V3 (boot) to R8 (milk stage) was effective in
reducing medusahead seed head production, clipping after anthesis almost
eliminated seed production. However, the observed decline in crude
protein at this point (11-8{\%}) suggests that the transition from R4
(emergence of awns) to R5 (anthesis) is also the point at which
medusahead becomes both unpalatable and not adequately nutritious to
livestock. As a consequence there was a window of 10 to 15 days when
90{\%} or more of medusahead reproductive tillers are susceptible to
grazing but could also support nutritional needs of cattle and sheep to
prevent avoidance in diet selection. In contrast, the window of
opportunity for mowing, on average, extended for about 35 days. In a
given year, the timing in which different medusahead populations entered
each phenological stage varied at both the landscape and pasture scale,
which creates both challenges and opportunities in using grazing animals

tactic because it has been shown to immobilize inorganic N, which should
confer a competitive advantage to slower growing plants that are often
key components of the desired plant community. Disparate experimental
and survey results have led to questions about the appropriate quality
and quantity of C to apply. We conducted a single-season glasshouse
experiment in three soil types to determine how the quality (sugar,
sawdust, sugar + sawdust), quantity (1 and 5 kg sugar or sawdust/m(2)),
and mode of application (surface applied or mixed into soil) of C
affected soil inorganic N pools, net mineralization rates, and
aboveground biomass of coexisting C3 and C4 plant species. Carbon
applied as sawdust mixed into the soil resulted in the highest level of
immobilization in the short term (6 weeks), but all combinations and
rates of sugar and sawdust application resulted in immobilization over
this period. In the long term (24 weeks), most amendments immobilized N

inorganic N pool at season's end, which calls into question its
effectiveness if longer-term benefits are desired. Neither net

the most important factors driving decreases in plant diversity.
However, we still do not fully understand which processes (niche process
or neutral process) are more important in leading to decreases in plant
diversity caused by fertilization. A hypothesis-based approach was used
to test the relative importance of niche versus neutral processes along
a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow community on the eastern
Tibetan plateau, China. Niche overlap values were calculated for species
biomass, and the null model was used to generate the values of niche
overlap expected at random. A linear regression modeling was used to
evaluate the relationship between functional traits (specific leaf area,
leaf dry matter content, and leaf total nitrogen concentration) and
species relative abundance. Our results demonstrated that observed niche
overlap for species biomass was significantly higher than expected at
lower fertilization gradients. Moreover, we also found a significantly
negative correlation between species relative abundance and specific
leaf area and leaf dry matter content, but a significantly positive
correlation between relative abundance and leaf nitrogen concentration
at lower fertilization gradients. However, these relationships were not
significant at higher fertilization gradients. We concluded that
community assembly is dynamic progression along the environmental

species diversity loss in response to fertilization.},

abstract = {Background: C-4 grasses were not abundant in North America during the
middle Miocene (c. 15 Ma). They did not become abundant until around 7
Ma. One can analyse stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18)
isotope values in the enamel of fossil horse teeth to determine the
extent to which horses were eating C-4 grasses even during the period
before those grasses became abundant.
Questions: In southern California, what proportion of a middle Miocene
horse's diet was made up of C-4 grasses? Was the amount enough to
influence the size and shape of horse teeth?
Organisms: Eighty-five specimens of five fossil horse species -
Acritohippus stylodontus, Archaeohippus mourningi, Merychippus
californicus, Scaphohippus intermontanus, and Scaphohippus sumani - from
the middle Miocene (c. 16 Ma) of southern California (i.e. Barstow
Formation, Cajon Valley Formation, and Temblor Formation).
Methods: To determine if C-4 grasses were present in middle Miocene
horse diets, we analysed stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta
O-18) isotope values from the enamel of the fossils. If the result did
indicate C-4 foraging at a locality, we modelled the percentage of C-4
grasses in equid diets using Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) v.
4.2.2.
Results: Modelled percentage C-4 in equid diets was {\textless} 20{\%}. Each
formation was statistically significantly different from the others in
terms of delta C-13 values. Barstow specimens had the highest values,
those from Cajon Valley the lowest, and those from Temblor were
intermediate. Those results indicate that horses ate C-4 grasses within
the Barstow and possibly the Temblor Formation but not the Cajon Valley
Formation. Within the Barstow sample, Scaphohippus sumani had
statistically significantly lower delta C-13 but statistically
significantly higher delta O-18 values than Acritohippus stylodontus,
suggesting a higher proportion of C-3 grasses in the diet of
Scaphohippus sumani versus a higher proportion of C-4 grasses for
Acritohippus stylodontus. The latter species also had higher tooth
crowns, consistent with a diet richer in C-4 grasses. There were no
statistically significant differences between species at Cajon Valley
for either delta C-13 or delta O-18. The delta C-13 values for
Merychippus californicus suggest that the habitats of the Temblor
Formation had a low percentage ({\textless} 6{\%}) of C-4 plants.
Conclusions: C-4 grasses lived in the mid-Miocene landscape in southern
California up to 8 million years before the rapid increase in C-4
ecosystems that occurred worldwide about 7 to 5 Ma. Horses foraged these
grasses, so hypotheses related to horse morphological evolution must
take C-4 plants into account.},

abstract = {A central goal of ecosystem ecology is to understand how the cycling of
nutrients and the growth of organisms are linked. Ecologists have
repeatedly observed that nutrient mineralization and plant production
are closely coupled in time in many terrestrial ecosystems. Typically,
mineralization rates of limiting nutrients, particularly of nitrogen,
during the growing season determine nutrient availability while pools of
mineral nutrients remain low and relatively constant. Although several
previous reports suggest nitrogen mineralization has the potential to
vary seasonally and out of phase with plant production, such a
phenomenon has been poorly documented. Here we report results from a
semiarid savanna ecosystem characterized by distinct temporal asynchrony
in rates of soil nitrogen cycling and plant production. Periods of
positive plant growth following the onset of rains coincide with periods
of low N turnover rates, whereas higher rates occur late in the wet
season following plant senescence and throughout dry seasons. Plant
uptake from the substantial mineral N pool present early in the growing
season is sufficient to explain most of the N allocation to aboveground
plant biomass during the growing season, even in the absence of any
wet-season mineralization. The mineral N pool is subsequently recharged
by late wet- and dry-season mineralization, plus urine inputs at sites
with high levels of ungulate activity. These findings suggest
fundamental changes in the quality of substrates available to
decomposers over a seasonal cycle, with significant implications for the
partitioning of limiting nutrients by plant species, the seasonal
pattern of nutrient limitations of aboveground production, and the
effective use of N fertilizers in semiarid ecosystems.},

abstract = {To investigate how plant diversity affects ecosystem-level processes
such as primary production and nutrient cycling, I established an
experimental plant diversity gradient in serpentine grassland using four
functional groups of plants: early season annual forbs (E), late season
annual forbs (L), perennial bunchgrasses (P), and nitrogen fixers (N).
These groups differ in growth form, phenology, and other traits relevant
to nutrient cycling (e.g., rooting depth, litter C:N ratio). Two or
three species of each type were planted in single-group treatments, and
in two-, three-, and four-way combinations, giving a range of richness
from zero to nine species. I tested the hypothesis that, because of
complementary resource use, increasing functional group diversity will
lead to higher net primary production. At the scale of this experiment
(alpha-diversity and yearly production), more diverse treatments were
not necessarily the most productive. Live plant biomass varied more
within than among levels of diversity. In most two-, three-, and
four-way mixtures of functional groups, overall productivity did not
differ significantly from the average of the yields of component
one-group treatments. This pattern apparently resulted from competition:
early season annuals and late season annuals reduced the biomass of
perennial bunchgrasses (the most productive group in monoculture) below
levels expected from monoculture yields.
Relative Yield Totals (RYT) indicated complementary resource use in the
EL and LP two-way and ELPN four-way mixtures. In the EL mixture,
complementarity appeared to result from temporal rather than spatial
partitioning of resources. Because of shifts in root:shoot ratio in
mixtures, however, only the LP treatment had consistently significant
RYT {\textgreater}1 when assessing total (roots plus shoots) productivity and
nitrogen yield. These results show that (1) composition (the identity of
the species present) can be at least as important as richness (the
number of species present) in effects on ecosystem processes; (2)
competition during critical parts of the growing season may prevent
absolute increases in net primary production with increasing diversity,
despite complementary resource use at other times of the year; and (3)
shifts in belowground allocation in species mixtures can have
significant effects on estimates of productivity and resource use as
species diversity changes.},

took to traverse areas of varying diameter revealed patches of 6-9-m
diameter in the pastures with low, and 18-21-m diameter in the pastures
with high tree canopy cover. In agreement with the current model,
crookedness of cow paths had two distinct domains. Within distances of
0-40 m, paths were relatively straight and similar, but from 40 to 200
m, they became increasingly tortuous. Correlation of sequential turning
angles identified patches of movement with diameters between 40 and 100
m, which correspond to the `patch' level of grazing within grazing
sites. Seasonal changes in meal patterns were consistent with changes in
temperature and forage quality and interacted with the distribution of
shade. Thus, spatial distribution of grazing and temporal distribution
of meals were inextricably linked. Low forage quality and high
temperatures in summer resulted in highly concentrated grazing around
trees. Conversely, winter and early spring forages of very high quality
and low availability motivated more widely distributed grazing, with low

grazing are common, despite the lack of an overarching quantitative
basis for assessing livestock effects on different plant groups. Given
the wide range of soils, climate and topography over which grasslands

grazing effects across a region. We performed a meta-analysis of

yet their cover response was weak and variable depending on grazing
regime and precipitation. Exotic grass cover was unaffected while
richness was enhanced by grazing. Native grass cover generally increased
with grazing, although the high variation among studies was not

the relationship between terrain attributes and quantity and
spectroscopic characteristics of SOC for a hillslope system in Southern

positions with a history of intense erosion. We observed a strong
relationship between slope, plan and profile curvature, and quantity and
quality of SOC accumulation along the hillslope systems. Specifically,
moderate slopes ({\textless}15{\%}) combined with concave profile and plan curvature
led to greater SOC accumulation. Spectroscopic analysis of water
extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and bulk SOC shows greater presence of
aromatics at eroding sites than at depositional sites, likely due to the
contribution of eroded upslope materials. These differences in SOC and
WEOC are the result of landscape-scale processes of SOC respiration by
soil microflora. They likely reflect the potential for SOC stabilization

abstract = {This article provides an analysis of a wetland site in southern Illinois
from presettlement to the present. The study area is part of the Cache
River-Cypress Creek Wetland, which has international importance, as
recognized by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Land-cover data for
1807, 1938, and 1993 were created and analyzed with a geographic
information system (GIS). Land-use change by topographic setting
(uplands, transitional, and bottomlands) and soil productivity was
quantified and studied. Interviews with local experts informed this
analysis. Results illustrate the complexity of environmental change and
its driving forces. First, notable forest and swamp acreage was
converted to cropland between 1807 and 1938 and, to a lesser degree,
from 1938 to 1993. Second, there were land-use variations by topographic
region. Between 1807 and 1938, the largest transformation occurred in
the uplands, with substantial acreage converted from forest to cropland.
Between 1938 and 1993, however, agriculture decreased in the upland
areas as hilly areas reverted to forest cover. At the same time,
agriculture expanded in the bottomlands as this land was drained for
farming. Third, there are interesting patterns within these categories
of land-use change, as soil productivity is an indicator of what lands
were taken out of cropland and converted back to grassland and forest.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Climate-induced forest retreat has profound
ecological and biogeochemical impacts, but the physiological mechanisms
underlying past tree mortality are poorly understood, limiting
prediction of vegetation shifts with climate variation. Climate,
drought, fire, and grazing represent agents of tree mortality during the
late Cenozoic, but the interaction between drought and declining
atmospheric carbon dioxide ({\{}[{\}}CO2](a)) from high to near-starvation
levels similar to 34 million years (Ma) ago has been overlooked. Here,
this interaction frames our investigation of sapling mortality through
the interdependence of hydraulic function, carbon limitation, and
defense metabolism.
Methods: We recreated a changing Cenozoic {\{}[{\}}CO2](a) regime by growing
Sequoia sempervirens trees within climate-controlled growth chambers at
1500, 500, or 200 ppm {\{}[{\}}CO2](a), capturing the decline toward minimum
concentrations from 34 Ma. After 7 months, we imposed drought conditions
and measured key physiological components linking carbon utilization,
hydraulics, and defense metabolism as hypothesized interdependent
mechanisms of tree mortality.
Key results: Catastrophic failure of hydraulic conductivity,
carbohydrate starvation, and tree death occurred at 200 ppm, but not 500
or 1500 ppm {\{}[{\}}CO2](a). Furthermore, declining {\{}[{\}}CO2](a) reduced
investment in carbon-rich foliar defense compounds that would diminish
resistance to biotic attack, likely exacerbating mortality.
Conclusions: Low-{\{}[{\}}CO2](a)-driven tree mortality under drought is
consistent with Pleistocene pollen records charting repeated Californian
Sequoia forest contraction during glacial periods (180-200 ppm
{\{}[{\}}CO2](a)) and may even have contributed to forest retreat as
grasslands expanded on multiple continents under low {\{}[{\}}CO2](a) over the
past 10 Ma. In this way, geologic intervals of low {\{}[{\}}CO2](a) coupled
with drought could impose a demographic bottleneck in tree recruitment,
driving vegetation shifts through forest mortality.},

both the success of exotics in the novel environment as well as
diversity and abundance of native species. Invasive species are often
characterized by multiple introductions in the novel range, which can
lead to population differentiation for invasion characteristics. Here we
use two invasive lineages of the exotic grass, Aegilops triuncialis L.,
to determine if these lineages differ in their response to competitors
and in their persistence in the invaded range. We find that one lineage
is negatively affected by competitor presence in both flowering
phenology and reproductive output, while the other lineage shows no
response in either trait. Furthermore, we find that the two lineages
were introduced at different times and are each capable of replacing the
other as the most abundant lineage of a given county. Our results
demonstrate that genetic lineage is a more important determinant of
competitive response than neighbor identity, and that the two lineages
may employ alternate invasion mechanisms. Because management techniques
are decided upon based on traits that confer invasiveness, our results
highlight the importance of considering intraspecific variation in the
invaded range.},

sodic soil landscapes. Our objective was to determine the conditions and
processes responsible for slickspot soil genesis in a closed basin
grassland in the Central Coast Range province of California. The
slickspots are irregularly shaped, 0.5 to 15 m long, and devoid of all
vegetation throughout the year. The adjacent soils under grass have
strong columnar structure below a thin ({\textless}5 cm) A horizon. In the
0.5-m-wide transition zone between grass-covered soils and slickspots,
the grass is sparse and stunted, the soil is eroded to the Bt horizon,
the columnar structure is degraded, and salt efflorescences rise from
{\textgreater}150 cm deep in the vegetated soil to within about 10 cm of the
slickspot soil surface. Infiltration is severely impeded in the crusted
slickspot soils, but not in the structured vegetated soils. Thus,
leaching predominates over evapotranspiration in the vegetated soils
(fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Haploxeralfs), but is
insignificant in the adjacent slickspot soils (fine, montmorillonitic,
thermic Typic Natrargids). Water and dissolved salts leached through the
vegetated soils move along a water potential gradient into the drier
slickspot subsoils, then upward, following a gradient established by
evaporation at the slickspot surface, resulting in salinization of the
slickspot soils. Carbon-dated relict grass roots from the slickspot
soils indicate that the slickspots have expanded at the expense of
grassland within the last few tens to hundreds of years. Water and wind
erosion at slickspot margins is increasing the size of these barren
areas, which are too dry, compacted, and saline for vegetation to become
reestablished.},

notably lacking are estimates of NEE with a few exceptions. The
objective of this study was to characterize the seasonal and annual
carbon flux of a desert shrub ecosystem using the eddy covariance
technique to determine the sensitivity of the system to the timing and
varying amounts of precipitation. Measurements began in July of 2001, a
year with 339mm of rainfall, considerably above the long-term average of
174mm and preceded by 2 years of below average rainfall (50-62mm). Over
the 2 complete years of measurements, precipitation was 147 and 197mm in
2002 and 2003, respectively. In all years, the majority of the
precipitation fell between August and September. The site was a sink of
-39 gCm(-2) yr(-1) in 2002 with a relatively strong uptake in the early
part of the year and reduced uptake after the suboptimal rainfall in
September. This contrasts with 2003 when the ecosystem took up -52
gCm(-2) yr(-1) concentrated in the fall after significant rain in August
and September. Likely, extremely low rainfall years would result in a
carbon loss while a strengthening of the typical winter secondary peak
in precipitation ( notably absent in the 2 years of measurements) may
extend uptake into the spring resulting in more carbon accumulation. The
system appears to be buffered against variations in annual rainfall
attributed to water storage in the stems and roots.},

total of 41 {\%} compared with the regime from 1950 to 1985. It may be
mainly attributed to numerous dams constructed in the tributaries, the
Gezhouba Dam constructed in the mainstream, and land use and land cover
change, e.g., the increased grassland with a coverage density larger
than 50 {\%}. The sediment regime alteration after 2003, assessed to be a
total of 83 {\%}, may be mainly attributed to the Three Gorges Reservoir.
It breaks the natural process of sediment transport, reduces sediment
concentration and releases clear water to the downstream which may
result in some environmental problems, e.g., limited nutrients
availability, river bed erosion, benthic habitat destruction, etc. The
assessment of sediment regime alteration may provide some references for
the environmental management and conservation of the Yangtze River.},

northern areas of Loess Plateau, China, suffers from both wind and water
erosion resulting in a nutrient-poor ecosystem. However, experimental
investigation of the effects of nitrogen deposition on grassland in this
region is scarce. In the current study, an in situ experiment was
initiated at the northern part of Loess Plateau, which is also a
coalmine base, to investigate the responses of Stipa bungeana dominant
grassland to nitrogen deposition. To indicate the ravine character of
Loess Plateau, China, experiments were conducted on two slopes with
opposite slope aspects. On each site, 3 m x 5 m plots were exposed to
either ambient N deposition (control) or ambient + 2.5 g m-2 yr-1 (low
N), + 5 g m-2 yr-1 (medium N), and + 10 g m-2 yr-1 (high N) added as
NH4NO3. After 1 year of N addition, the plots exposed to the added N had
significantly higher concentration of mineral N (NH4 +-N + NO3--N) in
the 0-20 cm soil layer compared to plots exposed to ambient N
deposition. Soil organic carbon and soil total N were not altered by the
N addition. S. bungeana exposed to the added N exhibited a significant
increase in aboveground tissue N concentration on shady and sunny sites
(p {\textgreater} 0.05), as well as an increase in N/P ratio. N concentrations of S.
bungeana and simulated N deposition levels had a clearly linear
relationship (R2 {\textgreater} 0.9). The N recovered in S. bungeana aboveground
tissue accounted for 16.4-27.2{\%} of the added N at the shady site, and
22-35{\%} at the sunny site. However, the tissue N or P concentration of
Lespedeza davurica, a legume plant, was not altered by the added N. The
effects of simulated N addition at the shady and sunny sites on the soil
and the plants were very similar; however, they differed in the extent
of soil and plant N concentration changes. Observations after 1 year of
N addition suggest that N addition can significantly and rapidly affect
N availability (mineral N) and gramineous plant tissue chemistry in the

(CO2), nitrogen (N) deposition, and climate change will alter ecosystem
productivity and function in the coming decades, the combined effects of
these environmental changes may be nonadditive, and their interactions
may be altered by disturbances, such as fire. We examined the influence
of a summer wildfire on the interactive effects of elevated CO2, N
deposition, and increased precipitation in a full-factorial experiment
conducted in a California annual grassland. In unburned plots, primary
production was suppressed under elevated CO2. Burning alone did not
significantly affect production, but it increased total production in
combination with nitrate additions and removed the suppressive effect of
elevated CO2. Increased production in response to nitrate in burned
plots occurred as a result of the enhanced aboveground production of
annual grasses and forbs, whereas the removal of the suppressive effect
of elevated CO2 occurred as a result of increased aboveground forb
production in burned, CO2-treated plots and decreased root production in
burned plots under ambient CO2.The tissue nitrogen-phosphorus ratio,
which was assessed for annual grass shoots, decreased with burning and
increased with nitrate addition. Burning removed surface litter from
plots, resulting in an increase in maximum daily soil temperatures and a
decrease in soil moisture both early and late in the growing season.
Measures of vegetation greenness, based on canopy spectral reflectance,
showed that plants in burned plots grew rapidly early in the season but
senesced early. Overall, these results indicate that fire can alter the
effects of elevated CO2 and N addition on productivity in the short
term, possibly by promoting increased phosphorus availability.},

a practical tool for habitat creation? Serpentine soils, in particular,
have three abiotic components thought to confer invasion resistance: a
low Ca:Mg ratio, low water-retention capacity, and high concentrations
of heavy metals. Consequently, not only do some serpentine-adapted
native plants persist only on serpentine soils, but also the community
members that depend upon those plants become dependent upon serpentine
as well. In an effort to provide additional habitat for the threatened
and serpentine-restricted Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha
bayensis), we experimentally altered a non-serpentine site to mimic the
abiotic conditions of serpentine. Attempts to lower the Ca:Mg ratio of
soils through the addition of MgSO(4) were unsuccessful. We then altered
soil depth through the addition of gravel beds to determine the effects
of water stress on native and non-native community composition. We found
that shallow soils had lower water content and correspondingly had
significantly lower non-native species richness and cover. The results
present promising means, but also cautionary information, for habitat
creation efforts and demonstrate the possible utility of edaphic
manipulation in abating non-native plant invasions. None of the

abstract = {1. Few experimental studies have tested how abundance and diversity of
grassland bryophytes respond to global environmental changes such as
climate shifts and eutrophication. Because bryophytes in grasslands are
low-statured, and because plant height is a key functional trait
governing plant responses to resource gradients, their responses to
these factors could resemble those of better-studied small vascular
plants. Alternatively, traits unique to bryophytes could lead to
qualitatively different responses than those of small vascular plants.
2. In a semi-arid Californian grassland system, where bryophytes are at
relatively low abundance and their ecology has been little studied, we
compared changes in cover and species richness of bryophytes and
short-statured vascular plants in response to 5years of experimental
fertilization, springtime watering and fertilization + watering, which
produced strong gradients in vascular plant biomass.
3. Supporting our hypotheses, the cover and richness of both bryophytes
and short vascular plants were negatively related to total community
biomass and tall vascular plant cover, and declined in response to the
fertilization + watering treatment, in which the cover of tall vascular
plants most strongly increased.
4. Two divergent responses were also observed as follows: watering alone
increased the cover of bryophytes but not short vascular plants, while
fertilization alone reduced the cover of short vascular plants but not
bryophytes.
5. Bryophytes and short-statured vascular plants in grasslands both may
be expected to decline under projected global changes in climate and
nutrient deposition that enhance total community biomass and competitive
pressure. However, shifts in either precipitation or eutrophication
regimes alone may have differential effects on bryophytes and short
vascular plants in grasslands, and organism-specific plant functional
traits must also be considered.},

abstract = {1. Elevated CO2 concentrations often lead to increased photosynthetic
carbon uptake in plants, but this does nor necessarily result in a
proportional increase in plant biomass. We examined this paradox for
grasslands in northern California that have been exposed to elevated CO2
since 1992. We evaluated the effects of physiological adjustments on
plant growth and carbon balance of the dominant species, Avena barbata,
using a plant growth model.
2. Without physiological adjustments, an observed 70{\%} increase in leaf
photosynthesis in elevated CO2 was predicted to increase plant biomass
by 97{\%} whereas experimental measurements suggested 5 and 13{\%} decreases
in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and a 40{\%} increase in 1994.
3. Simulations with an increase in carbon allocation to roots by 29{\%},
or leaf death rate by 80{\%}, or non-structural carbohydrate storage by
60{\%}, or leaf mass per unit area by 25{\%} each predicted an approximately
40{\%} increase in plant biomass in 1994 under elevated CO2. It follows
that greater suppression of the biomass responses to elevated CO2, in
1992 and 1993 resulted from variable combinations of these physiological
adjustments.
4. This modelling study concludes that (a) an increase in carbon loss or
(b) a decrease in carbon-use efficiency or (c) an increase in carbon
allocation to root growth will result in an increase in biomass growth
that is less than that in leaf photosynthesis under elevated CO2.
Alternatively, if carbon loss is reduced (e.g, depressed respiration)
and/or carbon allocation to leaf growth is increased, biomass growth may
be stimulated more than leaf photosynthesis by atmospheric CO2
concentration. Moreover, this modelling exercise suggests that
physiological adjustments may have substantial effects on ecosystem
carbon processes by varying ecosystem carbon influx, litterfall and
Litter quality.},

abstract = {Seasonally dry, water-limited regions are often co-dominated by distinct
herbaceous and woody plant communities with contrasting ecohydrological
properties. We investigated the shape of the above-ground net primary
productivity (ANPP) response to annual precipitation (P-a) for adjacent
grassland and shrubland ecosystems in Southern California, with the goal
of understanding the role of these ecohydrological properties on
ecosystem function. Our synthesis of observations and modelling
demonstrates grassland and shrubland exhibit distinct ANPP-P-a responses
that correspond with characteristics of the long-term P-a distribution
and mean water balance fluxes. For annual grassland, no ANPP occurs
below a precipitation compensation point,' where bare soil evaporation
dominates the water balance, and ANPP saturates above the P-a where deep
percolation and runoff contribute to the modelled water balance. For
shrubs, ANPP increases at a lower and relatively constant rate across
the P-a gradient, while deep percolation and runoff account for a
smaller fraction of the modelled water balance. We identify
precipitation seasonality, root depth, and water stress sensitivity as
the main ecosystem properties controlling these responses. Observed
ANPP-P-a responses correspond to notably different patterns of rain-use
efficiency (RUE). Grass RUE exceeds shrub RUE over a wide range of
typical P-a values, whereas grasses and shrubs achieve a similar RUE in
particularly dry or wet years. Inter-annual precipitation variability,
and the concomitant effect on ANPP, plays a critical role in maintaining
the balance of grass and shrub cover and ecosystem-scale productivity
across this landscape. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The normalized microwave reflection index (NMRI) is a measure of
multipath scattering calculated daily from continuously operating GPS
sites. GPS satellites transmit L-band microwave signals, and thus NMRI
is sensitive to the amount of water in vegetation, not plant greenness
or dry biomass. The sensing footprint is approximately 1000m(2),
although reflections from a distance of hundreds of metres are important
at some sites. NMRI exhibits clear seasonal variations that are linked
to the changes in vegetation water content that accompany plant growth
and senescence. In this paper, NMRI and the normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI) are compared for the period 2008-2012. NMRI data
are derived from 184 GPS sites in the western USA. NDVI data are from
the 250m, 16-day pixel containing each GPS station. Amplitude of the
annual growth cycle and correlation between NMRI and NDVI are estimated,
with and without lags. Phenology metrics are calculated from both
indices (i.e. the start of the growing season, timing of peak growth,
and season length). NMRI and NDVI are correlated at most sites, but the
degree of correlation varies regionally. Correlation is lowest in
California and coastal regions (R=0.25), where NDVI increases earlier in
the spring than NMRI. It is highest for mountain and prairie sites
(R=0.66 and 0.73, respectively). Allowing for a lag between NMRI and
NDVI greatly increases the correlation. The lag that yields the greatest
correlation is nearly 30 days for the California sites (R=0.71 with
lag), but only 10 days for mountain and prairie sites (R=0.78 and 0.85
with lag). There are clear differences in phenology metrics extracted
from NMRI and NDVI that are consistent with the correlation-lag
analysis. Using NMRI, there is a later start to the season, later peak
day of the year, and shorter season length. The greatest differences are
in California where NDVI start of the season is nearly 60 days earlier
than that calculated from NMRI. These data suggest that green-up
precedes increases in vegetation water content, with the duration of
offset varying regionally. This study is the first to compare
GPS-derived microwave reflectance data with NDVI at multiple sites, and
highlights both opportunities and limitations offered by NMRI data.},

understanding the diversity of plant-microbial interactions that occur

factors shape rhizosphere microbial communities, such as local soil
characteristics and the regional climate, and to determine the relative
influence of the rhizosphere on microbial community assembly compared to
the pressures imposed by the local and regional environment. We
identified the bacteria present in the soil immediately adjacent to the
roots of wild oat (Avena spp.) in three California grasslands using deep
Illumina 16S sequencing. Rhizosphere communities were more similar to
each other than to the surrounding soil communities from which they were
derived, despite the fact that the grasslands studied were separated by
hundreds of kilometers. The rhizosphere was the dominant factor
structuring bacterial community composition (38{\%} variance explained),
and was comparable in magnitude to the combined local and regional
effects (22{\%} and 21{\%}, respectively). Rhizosphere communities were most
influenced by factors related to the regional climate (soil moisture and
temperature), while background soil communities were more influenced by
soil characteristics (pH, CEC, exchangeable cations, clay content). The
Avena core microbiome was strongly phylogenetically clustered according
to the metrics NRI and NTI, which indicates that selective processes
likely shaped these communities. Furthermore, 17{\%} of these taxa were
not detectable in the background soil, even with a robust sequencing
depth of approximately 70,000 sequences per sample. These results
support the hypothesis that roots select less abundant or possibly rare
populations in the soil microbial community, which appear to be lineages
of bacteria that have made a physiological tradeoff for rhizosphere
competence at the expense of their competitiveness in non-rhizosphere

new opportunity to retest functional responses of photosynthesis to
abiotic factors at the ecosystem level, but examining the effects of one
factor (e.g., temperature) on photosynthesis remains a challenge as
other factors may confound under circumstances of natural experiments.
In this study, we developed a data mining framework to analyze a set of
ecosystem CO2 fluxes measured from three eddy-covariance towers, plus a
suite of abiotic variables (e.g., temperature, solar radiation, air, and
soil moisture) measured simultaneously, in a Californian oak-grass
savanna from 2000 to 2015. Natural covariations of temperature and other
factors caused remarkable confounding effects in two particular
conditions: lower light intensity at lower temperatures and drier air
and soil at higher temperatures. But such confounding effects may cancel
out. At the ecosystem level, photosynthetic responses to temperature did
follow a quadratic function on average. The optimum value of
photosynthesis occurred within a narrow temperature range (i.e., optimum
temperature, T (opt)): 20.6 +/- 0.6, 18.5 +/- 0.7, 19.2 +/- 0.5, and
19.0 +/- 0.6 A degrees C for the oak canopy, understory grassland,
entire savanna, and open grassland, respectively. This paradigm confirms
that photosynthesis response to ambient temperature changes is a
functional relationship consistent across leaf-canopy-ecosystem scales.
Nevertheless, T (opt) can shift with variations in light intensity, air
dryness, or soil moisture. These findings will pave the way to a direct
determination of thermal optima and limits of ecosystem photosynthesis,
which can in turn provide a rich resource for baseline thresholds and
dynamic response functions required for predicting global carbon balance
and geographic shifts of vegetative communities in response to climate

the capacity to dramatically alter native communities. However,
surprisingly few studies have quantified the effects of exotic plant
species on the communities they invade, or have considered how these
effects vary among habitat types or seasons. Here, we used both
comparative and experimental field studies to investigate the influence
of Cape ivy (Delairea odorata; Asteraceae), an invasive evergreen vine
native to South Africa, on three habitat types in coastal regions of
northern California (coastal scrub, willow riparian, and alder
riparian). In the comparative study, plots invaded by Cape ivy contained
36{\%} fewer native plant species and 37{\%} fewer normative taxa, and this
pattern persisted across habitat types and seasons. The richness of
grass and forb species was lower in invaded plots, whereas fern and
shrub richness did not vary among zones. Native species richness was
significantly lower with increasing cover of Cape ivy, but this was not
the case for normative species. In addition, invasion by Cape ivy was
associated with a 31{\%} decrease in species diversity as well as an 88{\%}
decrease in the abundance of native seedlings and a 92{\%} decrease in
normative seedlings compared to uninvaded areas. After 2 yr, a Cape-ivy
reduction experiment yielded similar results, with a 10{\%} increase in
the richness of native species compared to control plots, and a 43{\%}
increase in the richness of normative taxa. Forb species richness
increased significantly when Cape-ivy cover was reduced, whereas shrub
richness decreased slightly and no effects were detected for ferns and
grasses. We also found that Cape-ivy reduction led to a 32{\%} increase in
plant species diversity, an 86{\%} increase in the abundance of native
seedlings, and an 85{\%} increase for normative seedlings. In all cases,
the effects of Cape-ivy reduction were consistent across habitat types.
Collectively, our results indicate that this invader has significantly
changed the composition of three different habitat types, and its
control should be a major priority. However, our data also indicate that
Cape ivy had negative effects on the richness of both native and
normative plant species. Such findings suggest that a consequence of
removing Cape ivy from invaded areas may be to facilitate the
proliferation of other normative species.},

abstract = {Wildfire in California annual grasslands is an important ecological
disturbance and ecosystem control. Regional and global climate changes
that affect aboveground biomass will alter fire-related nutrient loading
and promote increased frequency and severity of fire in these systems.
This can have long-term impacts on soil microbial dynamics and nutrient
cycling, particularly in N-limited systems such as annual grasslands. We
examined the effects of a low-severity fire on microbial biomass and
specific microbial lipid biomarkers over 3 years following a fire at the
Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment. We also examined the impact of
fire on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), specifically
Nitrosospira Cluster 3a ammonia-oxidizers, and nitrification rates 9
months post-fire. Finally, we examined the interactive effects of fire
and three other global change factors (N-deposition, precipitation and
CO2) on plant biomass and soil microbial communities for three growing
seasons after fire. Our results indicate that a low-severity fire is
associated with earlier season primary productivity and higher soil-NH4
(+) concentrations in the first growing season following fire.
Belowground productivity and total microbial biomass were not influenced
by fire. Diagnostic microbial lipid biomarkers, including those for
Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, were reduced by fire
9- and 21-months post-fire, respectively. All effects of fire were
indiscernible by 33-months post-fire, suggesting that above and
belowground responses to fire do not persist in the long-term and that
these grassland communities are resilient to fire disturbance. While
N-deposition increased soil NH4 (+), and thus available NH3, AOB
abundance, nitrification rates and Cluster 3a AOB, similar increases in
NH3 in the fire plots did not affect AOB or nitrification. We
hypothesize that this difference in response to N-addition involves a
mediation of P-limitation as a result of fire, possibly enhanced by
increased plant competition and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-plant
associations after fire.},

abstract = {Shrub encroachment, a widespread phenomenon in arid landscapes, creates
`` islands of fertility'' in degraded systems as wind erosion removes
nutrient-rich soil from intercanopy areas and deposits it in nearby
shrub-vegetated patches. These islands of fertility generally are
considered to be irreversible. Recently, fire has been observed to alter
this pattern of resource heterogeneity through the redistribution of
nutrients from the fertile islands of burnt shrubs to the surrounding
bare soil areas. Despite the recognized relevance of both fires and wind
erosion to the structure and function of arid ecosystems, the
interactions between these two processes remains poorly understood. This
study tests the hypothesis that fire-induced soil hydrophobicity
developing in the soils beneath burned shrubs enhances soil erodibility
by weakening the interparticle wet-bonding forces. To test this
hypothesis, the effects of grass and shrub fires on changes in soil
erodibility and on the intensity of fire-induced soil water repellency
are compared at both the field and patch scales in heterogeneous arid
landscapes. Higher water repellency was observed in conjunction with a
stronger decrease in wind erosion threshold velocity around the shrubs
than in grass-dominated patches affected by fire, while neither water
repellency nor changes in threshold velocity was noticed in the bare
soil interspaces. Thus, fires are found to induce soil hydrophobicity
and to consequently enhance soil erodibility in shrub-vegetated islands
of fertility. These processes create temporally dynamic islands of
fertility and contribute to a decrease in resource heterogeneity in
aridland ecosystems following fire.},

carbon (C) sequestration in grasslands, but the net greenhouse gas
fluxes of amendments such as manure, compost, and inorganic fertilizers
remain unclear. To evaluate opportunities for climate change mitigation
through soil amendment applications, we designed a field-scale model
that quantifies greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from the
production, application, and ecosystem response of soil amendments.
Using this model, we developed a set of case studies for grazed annual
grasslands in California. Sensitivity tests were performed to explore
the impacts of model variables and management options. We conducted
Monte Carlo simulations to provide estimates of the potential error
associated with variables where literature data were sparse or spanned
wide ranges. In the base case scenario, application of manure slurries
led to net emissions of 14 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) over a 3-year period.
Inorganic N fertilizer resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions than
the manure (3 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)), assuming equal rates of N addition and
NPP response. In contrast, composted manure and plant waste led to large
offsets that exceeded emissions, saving 23 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) over 3
years. The diversion of both feedstock materials from traditional
high-emission waste management practices was the largest source of the
offsets; secondary benefits were also achieved, including increased
plant productivity, soil C sequestration, and reduced need for
commercial feeds. The greenhouse gas saving rates suggest that compost
amendments could result in significant offsets to greenhouse gas
emissions, amounting to over 28 MMg CO(2)e when scaled to 5{\%} of
California rangelands. We found that the model was highly sensitive to
manure and landfill management factors and less dependent on C
sequestration, NPP, and soil greenhouse gas effluxes. The Monte Carlo
analyses indicated that compost application to grasslands is likely to
lead to net greenhouse gas offsets across a broad range of potential
environmental and management conditions. We conclude that applications
of composted organic matter to grasslands can contribute to climate
change mitigation while sustaining productive lands and reducing waste

light absorption, and photosynthetic activity. These indices, which are
derived from canopy reflectance in the red and near-infrared wavebands,
highlighted phenological differences between evergreen and deciduous
canopies. They were poor indicators of total canopy biomass due to the
varying abundance of non-green standing biomass in these vegetation
types. However, in sparse canopies (leaf area index {\{}[{\}}LAI] approximate
to 0-2), NDVI was a sensitive indicator of canopy structure and chemical
content (green biomass, green leaf area index, chlorophyll content, and
foliar nitrogen content). At higher canopy green LAI values ({\textgreater} 2;
typical of dense shrubs and trees), NDVI was relatively insensitive to
changes in canopy structure. Compared to SR, NDVI was better correlated
with indicators of canopy structure and chemical content, but was
equivalent to the logarithm of SR. In agreement with theoretical
expectations, both NDVI and SR exhibited near-linear correlations with
fractional PAR intercepted by green leaves over a wide range of canopy
densities. Maximum daily photosynthetic rates were positively correlated
with NDVI and SR in annual grassland and semideciduous shrubs where
canopy development and photosynthetic activity were in synchrony. The
indices were also correlated with peak springtime canopy photosynthetic
rates in evergreens. However, over most of the year, these indices were
poor predictors of photosynthetic performance in evergreen species due
to seasonal reductions in photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency that
occurred without substantial declines in canopy greenness. Our results
support the use of these vegetation indices as remote indicators of PAR
absorption, and thus potential photosynthetic activity, even in
heterogeneous landscapes. To provide accurate estimates of
vegetation-atmosphere gas fluxes, remote NDVI and SR measurements need
to be coupled with careful estimates of canopy photosynthetic
radiation-use efficiency.},

transport in the soil C cycle and soil-atmosphere C exchange. We
combined a hillslope sediment transport model with empirical soil C
measurements to quantify the erosion and temporal storage of soil
organic carbon (SOC) within two grasslands in central California. The
sites have contrasting erosional mechanisms: biological perturbation (
Tennessee Valley ( TV)) versus clay-rich soil creep ( Black Diamond (
BD)). The average SOC erosion rates from convex slopes were 1.4 - 2.7 g
C m(-2) yr(-1) at TV and 5 - 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at BD, values that are {\textless}
10{\%} of above ground net primary productivity ( ANPP) at both sites. The
eroded soil accumulates on depositional slopes. The long term SOC
accumulation ( or C sink) rates are similar to 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in
the TV hollow and 1.7 - 2.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the BD footslope. We
found that the hillslope C sink is driven primarily by the burial of in
situ plant production rather than preservation of eroded SOC, a finding
that differs from existing hypotheses. At TV, the net sequestration of
atmospheric C by long-term hollow evacuation and refilling depends on
the fate of the C exported from the zero order watershed. This study
suggests that erosion and deposition are coupled processes that create a
previously unrecognized C sink in undisturbed upland watersheds, with a
potential to substantially affect the global C balance presently, and
over geological timescales.},

was surveyed. Results of the seed bank study indicated that greater
numbers of native plant species and native seeds germinated in intact
chaparral compared to road areas, whereas numbers of exotic plant
species and seeds germinating were similar in the two habitats. Burning
reduced the number of native species and seeds that germinated, and to a
lesser extent the number of exotic species and seeds that germinated
from the seed bank. In the field survey, intact chaparral areas had
greater numbers of native species and greater native cover than roads,
whereas road areas had greater numbers and cover of exotic species.
Several species were found only in field surveys; in particular, few
chaparral shrub seeds germinated from the seed bank. Similarity between
the seed bank and vegetation was low in both chaparral and road sites.
The results suggest that although many native species of chaparral

measured soil nitrogen (N) availability, leaf N and isotopes, water
isotopes, and gas exchange of dominant shrub species Atriplex torreyi
and Ericameria nauseosa and grass species Distichlis spicata throughout
the summer season in three sites that had similar watertable depths, but
that varied in community composition and N availability. Surface soil
inorganic N was greatest at the grassland site and declined from June to
September at all sites. Leaf N declined throughout the season in all
species, and was correlated with soil inorganic N. Photosynthesis of A.
torreyi remained relatively constant throughout the season. In contrast,
D. spicata and E. nauseosa experienced seasonal declines in
photosynthesis at sites with greater inorganic N availability. Leaf N
was significantly correlated with photosynthesis in D. spicata across
all sites and measurement periods. Controls on N cycling are likely to
be an important determinant of photosynthesis of D. spicata in this
region.},

abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services - the benefits that nature provides to
human's society - has gained increasing attention over the past decade.
Increasing global abiotic and biotic change, including species
invasions, is threatening the secure delivery of these ecosystem
services. Efficient evaluation methods of ecosystem services are
urgently needed to improve our ability to determine management
strategies and restoration goals in face of these new emerging
ecosystems. Considering a range of multiple ecosystem functions may be a
useful way to determine such strategies. We tested this framework
experimentally in California grasslands, where large shifts in species
composition have occurred since the late 1700's. We compared a suite of
ecosystem functions within one historic native and two non-native
species assemblages under different grazing intensities to address how
different species assemblages vary in provisioning, regulatory and
supporting ecosystem services. Forage production was reduced in one
non-native assemblage (medusahead). Cultural ecosystem services, such as
native species diversity, were inherently lower in both non-native
assemblages, whereas most other services were maintained across grazing
intensities. All systems provided similar ecosystem services under the
highest grazing intensity treatment, which simulated unsustainable
grazing intensity. We suggest that applying a more comprehensive
ecosystem framework that considers multiple ecosystem services to
evaluate new emerging ecosystems is a valuable tool to determine
management goals and how to intervene in a changing ecosystem.},

matter decomposition rates have been widely acknowledged, but are poorly
understood. Understanding these relationships is complicated by the fact
that microbial community structure and function are likely to both
affect and be affected by organic matter quality and chemistry, thus it
is difficult to draw mechanistic conclusions from field studies. We
conducted a reciprocal soil inoculum x litter transplant laboratory
incubation experiment using samples collected from a set of sites that
have similar climate and plant species composition but vary
significantly in bacterial community structure and litter quality. The
results showed that litter quality explained the majority of variation
in decomposition rates under controlled laboratory conditions: over the
course of the 162-day incubation, litter quality explained nearly
two-thirds (64 {\%}) of variation in decomposition rates, and a smaller
proportion (25 {\%}) was explained by variation in the inoculum type. In
addition, the relative importance of inoculum type on soil respiration
increased over the course of the experiment, and was significantly
higher in microcosms with lower litter quality relative to those with
higher quality litter. We also used molecular phylogenetics to examine
the relationships between bacterial community composition and soil
respiration in samples through time. Pyrosequencing revealed that
bacterial community composition explained 32 {\%} of the variation in
respiration rates. However, equal portions (i.e., 16 {\%}) of the
variation in bacterial community composition were explained by inoculum
type and litter quality, reflecting the importance of both the
meta-community and the environment in bacterial assembly. Taken
together, these results indicate that the effects of changing microbial
community composition on decomposition are likely to be smaller than the
potential effects of climate change and/or litter quality changes in
response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations or atmospheric
nutrient deposition.},

the supply rates of multiple nutrients control biodiversity, ecosystem
functions and ecosystem services in ecological communities, few
experimental studies have concurrently examined the independent and
joint effects of multiple nutrients and mammalian consumers on these
responses in natural systems. Here we quantify the independent and
interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and
consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a
two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m(2) plots, we examine
interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients)
and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant
community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition,
3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4)
infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop
grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important
regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and
infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio
whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control
grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important
insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass
production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when
gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass
production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus,
nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host
increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus;
however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating
stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of
manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with
nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions
demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective
predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are
simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of
many nutrients.},

from Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington.
Field-collected forage samples from these accessions had nondetectable
or low levels of selenium, swainsonine, and nitrotoxins. Accessions were
evaluated at Providence and Millville in northern Utah in 2005 and 2006.
At Providence accessions from north-central Oregon exhibited
comparatively high biomass yield in summer and fall during both years.
Basalt milkvetch accessions with low biomass generally had high crude
protein concentration. Acid-detergent fiber and neutral-detergent fiber
were positively correlated with biomass yield (r = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.0001; r =
0.57, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). At Millville accessions from
north-central Oregon exhibited comparatively high biomass and seed

accessions in both years at Millville. Plants at Millville treated with
imadicloprid insecticide had greater seed yields than nontreated plants
in 2006, but not in 2005. When averaged across sites and years, a high
correlation between number of stems and biomass (r = 0.82, P {\textless} 0.0001)
indicated that number of stems is a reliable predictor of high biomass
and seed yield. Principal component analysis of seven consolidated plant
traits identified two principal components that accounted for 60{\%} and
15{\%} of the variation among accessions. The first principal component
was negatively correlated with elevation (r = -0.71, P {\textless} 0.01) and
positively correlated with latitude (r = 0.46, P {\textless} 0.01). The second

surveyed native and alien species cover in adjacent grazed and ungrazed

plants grown in pots and plants in the field that grew with and without

1999, 2000, and 2001, whereas alien species were unaffected. In the
experimental field plots, the European annual forb Erodium cicutarium

overcompensated and grasses undercompensated. In the field, European
grasses were unaffected by the removal of competitors. It is unclear by
what mechanism E. cicutarium was able to compensate, but the ability may
be related to its basal rosette growth form and indeterminately growing
inflorescences. The native California grassland community assembled in
the absence of grazing herds, whereas invasive European species have
been exposed to grazing for centuries. It may be that these invaders
have adaptations that better enable them to recover from grazing. In the

load, and to investigate the impact of geomorphic factors disturbance on

Mellah Catchment (550 km(2)) which was controlled by a gauging station
to measure discharge and sediment transport. The relations between daily
mean sediment concentration and daily mean water discharge were analyzed
to develop sediment rating curves. For storms with no water samples, a
sediment rating curve was developed. The technique involves
stratification of data into discharge-based classes, the mean of which
are used to fit a rating curve according to single flow data and season
to provide various rating relationships. The mean annual sediment yield
during the 24 years of the study period was 562 T km(-2) in the Mellah
Catchment. This drainage basin had high rainfall and runoff, the erosion
was high. The high sediment yield in the Mellah basin could be explained
by a high percentage of sparse grassland and cultivation developed on
shallow marly silty-clayey soils with steep slopes often exceeding 12{\%}.
Almost all suspended sediment loads are transported during storm events
that mainly occur in the winter and spring heavy and medium downpours.
The scarceness of these events leads to a very large interseasonal
variability of the wadi sediment fluxes. The negative impacts of this
enhanced sediment mobility are directly felt in the western part of the
basin which shows many mass movements, bank and gully erosion because
cultivated areas are often bared during autumnal brief flash floods and
furrowed downslope during the winter season.},

rural to urban landscapes and evaluated 2 hypotheses central to
strategic conservation planning: (1) population performance declines
with increasing human dominance and (2) small populations perform poorly
relative to larger ones. Assessing these hypotheses is critical to
strategic conservation planning. The current conservation paradigm
adheres to the well-established ecology theory that small isolated
populations, particularly those in human-dominated landscapes, are the
least likely to succeed over the long term. Consequently, conservation
planning has strongly favored large, remote targets for protection. This
shift in conservation toward ecosystem-based programs and protection of
populations within large, remote systems has been at the expense of
protection of the rarest of the rare species, the dominant paradigm for
conservation driven by the endangered species act. Yet, avoiding
conservation of small populations appears to be based more on
theoretical understanding and expert opinion than empiricism. We used
Natural Heritage data from California in an assessment of population
performance of rare plants across a landscape with an urban-rural
gradient. Population performance did not decrease in urban settings or
for populations that were initially small. Our results are consistent
with a pattern of few species extinctions within these landscapes over
the past several decades. We conclude that these populations within
compromised landscapes can contribute to overall biodiversity
conservation. We further argue that conservation planning for
biodiversity preservation should allocate relatively more resources to
protecting urban-associated plant taxa because they may provide
conservation benefit beyond simply protecting isolated populations; they
may be useful in building social interest in conservation.},

practitioners to incorporate a greater number of species into their
projects. But it is not yet clear how well BEF theory predicts outcomes
of restoration, because it has been developed through tests involving
short-run and tightly controlled (e. g., weeded) experiments. Thus, we
resampled our 1997 BEF experiment in a restored salt marsh to test for
long-term effects of species richness (plantings with 1, 3, and 6
species per 2 3 2 m plot), with multiple ecosystem functions as response
variables. Over 11 years, 1- and 6-species assemblages converged on
intermediate richness (mean 3.9 species/0.25-m 2 plot), and composition
changed nonrandomly throughout the site. While three species became
rare, the two most productive species became co-dominant. The two
dominants controlled and increased shoot biomass, which appeared to
decrease species richness. Diversity-function relationships became less
positive over 11 years and differed significantly with (a) the
species-richness metric (planted vs. measured), and (b) the indicator of
function (shoot biomass, height, and canopy layering). The loss of
positive relationships between species richness and function in our
restored site began soon after we stopped weeding and continued with
increasing dominance by productive species. Where species-rich plantings
are unlikely to ensure long-term restoration of functions, as in our

Aboveground biomass, plant cover, species richness, and plant basal area
were tracked for two growing seasons. Although total biomass was not
affected by C addition, the distribution of biomass among life forms was
affected: carbon addition reduced forb biomass but had no effect on
grasses or legumes. Total cover was lower in sugar-treated plots, and
sugar also altered the proportional composition of that cover by
reducing the abundance of forbs, especially in the first year. Five
species were particularly sensitive to sugar addition: Myosotis

Vulpia bromoides. Sugar also reduced plant basal area in the first year.
These results suggest that sugar and, to a lesser extent, AC could be

left on the ground at the end of the grazing season, is a commonly used
proxy for rangeland condition in Mediterranean climates. Moderate levels
of RDM are correlated with soil stability, forage production, wildlife
habitat, and diversity of native plants. Therefore RDM is widely
monitored on rangeland conservation properties. Current ground-based
methods for RDM monitoring are expensive, are labor intensive, and
provide information in the fall, after the effects of grazing have
already occurred. In this paper we present a cost-effective, rapid, and
robust methodology to monitor and predict RDM using Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. We performed a time
series analysis of three MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) measured
over the period 2000-2012: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active
Radiation (FPAR). We examined the correlation between the four VIs and
fall RDM measured at The Nature Conservancy's Simon Newman Ranch in
central California. We found strong and significant correlations between
maximum VI values in late spring and RDM in the fall. Among the VIs, LAI
values had the most significant correlation with fall RDM. MODIS-based
multivariate models predicted up to 63{\%} of fall RDM. Importantly,
maximum and sum VIs values were significantly higher in management units
with RDM levels in compliance with RDM conservation easement terms
compared with units out of compliance. On the basis of these results, we
propose a management model that uses time series analysis of MODIS VIs
to predict forage quantities, manage stocking rates, and monitor
rangeland easement compliance. This model can be used to improve
monitoring of rangeland conservation by providing information on range
conditions throughout the year. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

3 The selection of strategic or voracious microbial types in a spatially

voracious) microbial types are favoured under conditions of low plant

moderate microbial disturbance.

change, land use, and invasion by non-native plants. However,
understanding of the factors responsible for driving reestablishment of
grassland plant communities is largely derived from short-term studies.
In order to develop an understanding of the factors responsible for
longer term restoration outcomes in California annual grasslands, we
surveyed 12 fields in Davis, CA, U.S.A., in 2015 that were seeded with
native species mixtures starting in 2004. Using field surveys, we
investigated how invasive plant richness and cover, native plant
richness and cover, aboveground biomass, grazing, soil type, and
restoration species identity might provide utility for explaining
patterns of restoration success. We found a negative relationship
between invasive cover and restoration cover, which was attributed to
the slow establishment of seeded species and subsequent dominance by
weeds. The relationship between invasive cover and restoration cover was
modified by grazing, likely due to a change in the dominance of exotic
forbs, which have a more similar growing season to restoration species,
and therefore compete more strongly for late season moisture. Finally,
we found that soil type was responsible for differences in the identity
and abundance of invasive plants, subsequently affecting restoration
cover. This work highlights the value of focusing resources on reducing
invasive species cover, limiting grazing to periods of adequate
moisture, and considering soil type for successful long-term restoration
in California annual grasslands. Moreover, observations of long-term
restoration outcomes can provide insight into the way mechanisms driving
restoration outcomes might differ through time.},

climatic trends. In a heterogeneous California grassland, we documented
declining plant diversity from 2000 to 2014 at both the local community

native annual forbs, which are present as small seedlings in midwinter;
within native annual forbs, community composition changed toward lower
representation of species with a trait indicating drought intolerance
(high specific leaf area). Time series models linked diversity decline
to the significant decrease in midwinter precipitation. Livestock
grazing history, fire, succession, N deposition, and increases in exotic
species could be ruled out as contributing causes. This finding is among
the first demonstrations to our knowledge of climate-driven directional

functional composition could be a stronger control: species already in
the community with similar functional traits to those of the invaders
should have the greatest competitive effect on invaders. Still,
experiments assessing effects of functional similarity have found
contradictory results.
2. We used experimental communities in a serpentine grassland in
California, USA, to assess the extent to which functional composition
and functional diversity influenced success of two different types of
invading plants: early season annuals (E) and late-season annuals (L)
that have been previously shown to differ in patterns of resource
acquisition.
3. We seeded known quantities of seed of six different species (three in
each functional group) into experimental plots containing established
communities differing in functional composition and functional
diversity. The experimental communities contained different combinations
of E, L, perennial bunchgrass (P) and nitrogen-fixer (N) functional
groups, with functional diversity ranging from 0 to 4 groups. Each
invading species was seeded into a separate quadrat within each plot to
minimize competitive effects of invaders on each other. We measured both
seedling and adult success of invaders for two full growing seasons to
further understand mechanisms underlying biotic resistance.
4. More functionally diverse communities were less invaded overall, as
measured by the average success of individual invaders. However,
assessment of invaders by functional groups was more informative: Es in
the extant community suppressed E invaders the most, and Ls in the
extant community suppressed L invaders the most.
5. We observed a variety of interactions among extant functional groups
in reducing invader success, including synergism, complementarity and
`basement' effects, where two or more groups negatively affected
invaders, but combinations of groups were no more suppressive than
single groups. The extant community influenced invaders more strongly
through suppression of adult plant growth than through effects on
seedling establishment.
6. Synthesis. Contrary to predictions from neutral theory, these results
indicate that niche overlap was an important component of biotic
resistance in these experimental plant communities and summed up to
significant effects of species richness.},

abstract = {Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance
were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna,
chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species
richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to
1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community
diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we
would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous
flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover
increased with increasing native species richness in all communities.
This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native
competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives
and aliens.
Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and
consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All
of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have
displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have
greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich
regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these
grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites,
livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover
only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than
a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion.
In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years
after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and
alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these
ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a
consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive
presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien
species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species
encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in
this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which
alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the
shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine
alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance
in favor of alien invasion.
In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a
function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires
create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and
nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have
persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important
determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant
interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory
cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was
sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns,
and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on
high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected
alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about
one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer
than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned
coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some
burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a
challenge for fire restoration of these forests.},

grazing livestock, a worldwide problem, motivated the present study on
the effects of vegetative filter strips (VFS) for controlling pollutants
(nutrients, micro-organisms and sediment loading) from grazed, irrigated
pastures. Flood-irrigated pastures are an important source of forage for
livestock during summer months in California, USA when the surrounding
rangelands are dry and dormant. Significant amounts of runoff can be
generated from these pastures during irrigation events.
Nine plots on an irrigated pasture were assigned randomly to one of
three treatments: Control (no VFS), Treatment VFS-1 (8(.)3 x 7 in,
0(.)0058 ha VFS) and Treatment VFS-2 (17(.)1 x 7 m, 0(.)012 ha VFS). In
2000, two grazing events (in April and June/July) occurred during the
irrigation season prior to the experiment; further, the experimental
plots were grazed between irrigations 2 and 3. Attenuation of runoff
loads by VFS treatment was measured during four irrigation events
(between I August and 3 October 2000) for total suspended solids (TSS),
ortho-phosphate (Ortho-P), inorganic phosphate (Inorg-P), total
phosphate (Total-P), organic phosphate (Org-P), polyphosphate (Poly-P),
total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NH3, NO3 and presumptive faecal coliforms

On average, approximately 0(.)43 of the applied water left the plots as
runoff. Treatment effects approached significance for TSS and TKN and
were significant (P {\textless} 0(.)05) for Poly-P and NH3-Irrigation number
effects were significant for all but TSS, NO3 and FC. The effects of VFS
treatments were not consistent. Treatment VFS-2, although representing
the largest buffer strip, did not always produce the lowest pollutant
loads in runoff. Slope, relatively high runoff volumes and some
channelled flow were probably responsible for the limited effectiveness
of VFS in the present study. These results suggest that effectiveness of
VFS for reducing sediment and nutrient transport from irrigated pastures
may be questionable.},

temperatures have altered plant phenology-the timing of life events,
such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global
environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered
precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering
times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors
influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic
interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap
given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant
community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated
plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many
plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity,
with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species
lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant
diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil
moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in
high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings
illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can
alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these
changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by
climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or
exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global

We simulated realistic N deposition increases with low-level

monitored grazing intensity using camera traps and measured total
available N to assess grazing and nutrient enrichment effects on
microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA), microbial N

Continuous measures of grazing intensity and N availability showed that
increased grazing and N were correlated with increased microbial

fertilization measures. Exotic cover was also generally correlated with
increased microbial activity resulting from exotic-driven nutrient
cycling alterations. Seasonal effects, on abiotic factors and plant
phenology, were also an important factor in EEA with lower activity
occurring at peak plant biomass.
In combination with previous studies from this serpentine grassland, our

state government's recent inventory, California's carbon budget is
presently dominated by 115 MMTCE per year in fossil fuel emissions of
CO(2) ({\textgreater}85{\%} of total annual GHG emissions) to meet energy and
transportation requirements. Other notable (non-ecosystem) sources of
carbon GHG emissions in 2004 were from cement- and lime-making

activities (2{\%}). The NASA-CASA (Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach)
simulation model based on satellite observations of monthly vegetation
cover (including those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer, MODIS) was used to estimate net ecosystem fluxes and
vegetation biomass production over the period 1990-2004. California's
annual NPP for all ecosystems in the early 2000s (estimated by CASA at
120 MMTCE per year) was roughly equivalent to its annual fossil fuel
emission rates for carbon. However, since natural ecosystems can
accumulate only a small fraction of this annual NPP total in long-term
storage pools, the net ecosystem sink flux for atmospheric carbon across
the state was estimated at a maximum rate of about 24 MMTCE per year
under favorable precipitation conditions. Under less favorable
precipitation conditions, such as those experienced during the early
1990s, ecosystems statewide were estimated to have lost nearly 15 MMTCE

remains urgent, particularly because each CO2 experiment cannot run for
decades to centuries. Furthermore, predictions for a given biome need to
take into account differences in productivity and leaf area index (LAI)

weather records and field data from the Jasper Ridge CO2 experiment in
Pale Alto, California, to model the effects of CO2 and climate
variability on ecosystem water fluxes. The sandstone and serpentine
grasslands at Jasper Ridge provide a range of primary productivity and
LAI, with the sandstone as the more productive system. Modeled soil
water availability agreed well with published observations of
time-domain reflectometry in the CO2 experiment. Simulated water fluxes
based on 10-year weather data (January 1985-December 1994) showed that
the sandstone grassland had a much greater proportion of water movement
through plants than did the serpentine; transpiration accounted for
approximately 30{\%} of annual fluxes in the sandstone and only 10{\%} in
the serpentine. Although simulated physiological and biomass changes
were similar in both grasslands, the consequences of elevated CO2 were
greater for the sandstone water budget. Elevated CO2 increased soil
drainage by 20{\%} in the sandstone, despite an approximately one-fifth
increase in plant biomass; in the serpentine, drainage increased by
{\textless}10{\%} and soil evaporation was unchanged for the same simulated biomass
change. Phenological changes, simulated by a 15-day lengthening of the
growing season, had minimal impacts on the water budget. Annual
variation in the timing and amount of rainfall was important for water
fluxes in both grasslands. Elevated CO2 increased sandstone drainage {\textgreater}
50 mm in seven of ten years, but the relative increase in drainage
varied from 10{\%} to 300{\%} depending on the year. Early-season
transpiration in the sandstone decreased between 26{\%} and 41{\%}, with
elevated CO2 resulting in a simulated water savings of 54-76 mm. Even in
years when precipitation was similar (e.g., 505 and 479 mm in years 3
and 4), the effect of CO2 varied dramatically. The response of grassland
water budgets to CO2 depends on the productivity and structure of the
grassland, the amount and timing of rainfall, and CO2-induced changes in
physiology. In systems with low LAT, large physiological changes may not
necessarily alter total ecosystem water budgets dramatically.},

local scales and regional-scale management efforts to promote native
persistence. We used field experimentation to quantify propagule and
establishment limitation in a suite of native annual forbs in a
California reserve, and compared these findings to species abundance
trends within the same sites over the past 48 years. Observations at 11
paired sites (inside and outside the reserve) indicated that exotic
annual plants have continued to increase in abundance over the past 48
years. This trend suggests the system has not reached equilibrium {\textgreater}250
years after exotic species began to spread, and 70 years after livestock
grazing ceased within the reserve. Long-term monitoring observations
also indicated that six native annual forb species went extinct from
more local populations than were colonized. To determine the potential
role of exotic species in these native plant declines, we added seed of
these species into plots adjacent to monitoring sites where plant litter
and live grass competition were removed. Experimental results suggest
both propagule and establishment limitation have contributed to local
declines observed for these native forbs. Recruitment was highest at
sites that had current or historical occurrences of the seeded species,
and in plots where litter was removed. Grazing history (i.e., location
within or outside the reserve) interacted with exotic competition
removal, such that removal of live grass competition increased
recruitment in more recently grazed sites. Abundance of forbs was
positively related to recruitment, while abundance of exotic forbs was
negatively related. Thus, exotic competition is likely only one factor
contributing to local declines of native species in invaded ecosystems,
with a combination of propagule limitation, site quality, and land use
history also playing important and interactive roles in native plant

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentrations can influence ecosystem carbon storage
through net primary production (NPP), soil carbon storage, or both. In
assessing the potential for carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems
under elevated CO2, both NPP and processing of soil organic matter
(SOM), as well as the multiple links between them, must be examined.
Within this context, both the quantity and quality of carbon flux from
roots to soil are important, since roots produce specialized compounds
that enhance nutrient acquisition (affecting NPP), and since the flux of
organic compounds from roots to soil fuels soil microbial activity
(affecting processing of SOM).
From the perspective of root physiology, a technique is described which
uses genetically engineered bacteria to detect the distribution and
amount of flux of particular compounds from single roots to non-sterile
soils. Other experiments from several labs are noted which explore
effects of elevated CO2 on root acid phosphatase, phosphomonoesterase,
and citrate production, all associated with phosphorus nutrition. From a
soil perspective, effects of elevated CO2 on the processing of SOM
developed under a C4 grassland but planted with C3 California grassland
species were examined under low (unamended) and high (amended with 20 g
m(-2) NPK) nutrients; measurements of soil atmosphere delta(13)C
combined with soil respiration rates show that during vegetative growth
in February, elevated CO2 decreased respiration of carbon from C4 SOM in
high nutrient soils but not in unamended soils.
This emphasis on the impacts of carbon loss from roots on both NPP and
SOM processing will be essential to understanding terrestrial ecosystem
carbon storage under changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

altering ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. Among
approaches for predicting ecosystem responses, long-term observations
and manipulative experiments can be powerful approaches for resolving
single-factor and interactive effects of global changes on key metrics

developing multidimensional response surfaces for NPP based on the
longest-running, best-replicated, most-multifactor global-change
experiment at the ecosystem scale-a 17-y study of California grassland
exposed to full-factorial warming, added precipitation, elevated CO2,
and nitrogen deposition. Single-factor and interactive effects were not
time-dependent, enabling us to analyze each year as a separate
realization of the experiment and extract NPP as a continuous function
of global-change factors. We found a ridge-shaped response surface in
which NPP is humped (unimodal) in response to temperature and
precipitation when CO2 and nitrogen are ambient, with peak NPP rising
under elevated CO2 or nitrogen but also shifting to lower temperatures.
Our results suggest that future climate change will push this ecosystem
away from conditions that maximize NPP, but with large year-to-year
variability.},

significantly shifts the mass loss and nitrogen dynamics of plant litter
decomposition in semi-arid and arid ecosystems. In this study, we
examined the role of photodegradation in litter decomposition by using
the DayCent-UV biogeochemical model. DayCent-UV incorporated the
following mechanisms related to UV radiation: (1) direct photolysis, (2)
facilitation of microbial decomposition via production of labile
materials, and (3) microbial inhibition effects. We also allowed maximum
photodecay rate of the structural litter pool to vary with litter's
initial lignin fraction in the model. We calibrated DayCent-UV with
observed ecosystem variables (e.g., volumetric soil water content, live
biomass, actual evapotranspiration, and net ecosystem exchange), and
validated the optimized model with Long-Term Intersite Decomposition
Experiment (LIDET) observations of remaining carbon and nitrogen at
three semi-arid sites in Western United States. DayCent-UV better
simulated the observed linear carbon loss patterns and the persistent
net nitrogen mineralization in the 10-year LIDET experiment at the three
sites than the model without UV decomposition. In the DayCent-UV
equilibrium model runs, UV decomposition increased aboveground and
belowground plant production, surface net nitrogen mineralization, and
surface litter nitrogen pool, but decreased surface litter carbon, soil
net nitrogen mineralization, and mineral soil carbon and nitrogen. In
addition, UV decomposition had minimal impacts on trace gas emissions
and biotic decomposition rates. The model results suggest that the most
important ecological impact of photodecay of surface litter in dry
grasslands is to increase N mineralization from the surface litter
(25{\%}), and decay rates of the surface litter (15{\%}) and decrease the
organic soil carbon and nitrogen (5{\%}).},

The soil and water assessment tool was used to simulate nitrate loads in
different land cover types in different years. The landscape pattern was
calculated by FRAGSTATS. The contributing share of each land use/land
cover shows nitrate pollutant produced by grassland (5.7{\%}) and forest

Agricultural land was identified as the main source of nitrate
pollution. Paddy fields and orchards had the most intensive soluble
nitrate loss especially in spring and summer. Statistical analysis
indicated that nitrate was positively associated with patch density,
edge density, patch number, total edge, effective mesh size, largest
patch index, and landscape shape index (p {\textless}= 0.01). We then analyzed how
nitrate was related to landscape attributes in six different sites. Also
the regression analysis results suggested that landscape metrics could
account for more than 94{\%} of the variance of nitrate in the whole

abstract = {As Europeans colonized California, they introduced annual grasses from
the Mediterranean Basin. These exotic annual grasses eventually invaded
grasslands throughout the state, some of which were once dominated by
native perennial grass species. Annual grasses differ from perennials in
their phenology, longevity, rooting depth, litter chemistry, and
interaction with the microbial community. As these traits may influence
plant nitrogen (N) use, it is likely that the invasion by annual species
resulted in changes in the availability and cycling of N in California
grassland systems. We addressed the question of how invasive annual
grasses influence rates of N cycling by measuring N pool sizes and rates
of net and gross mineralization and nitrification, gross immobilization,
and the denitrification potential of soils from experimentally planted
annual and perennial-dominated grasslands. With an increase in annual
grass cover, we saw increases in ammonium (NH(4)(+)) pool sizes and
rates of N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification in soils.
These differences in N status suggest that N cycling in California
grasslands was altered at sites where native perennial bunchgrasses were
invaded by nonnative annual grasses. One consequence of annual grass
invasion may be a legacy of NH(4)(+)-enriched soils that hinder the
reestablishment of native perennial grass species.},

Modeling the phenology of moisture-driven annual grasslands in
Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) remains challenging because
although soil moisture is often a direct control on green-up, high
rainfall variability during MTE wet seasons makes predicting the optimal
time for senescence problematic. For this study, we developed a
Mediterranean grassland phenology model (MGPM) to model green-up and
senescence for coastal California annual grasslands. Mediterranean

Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, and simulations of ecosystem

was an accurate predictor of grassland green-up initiation. Annual
cumulative net primary productivity (NPPcum) was observed to be a good
predictor of senescence initiation, with higher levels of NPPcum
associated with delayed senescence initiation. We also observed that
photoperiod acts as an additional control on senescence initiation,
restricting the window of time during which senescence may occur.
Long-term peak NPPcum was noted as a potential control on the timing of
this photoperiod window. Inclusion of MGPM into biophysical models is
expected to improve the representation of annual grasslands and more

quality indicators and to evaluate the impact of six most prevalent land
use types (natural forestland, cultivated lowland, cultivated upland
terrace, shifting cultivation, plantation land, and grassland) on soil
quality in eastern Himalayan region of India. We collected 120 soil
samples (20 cm depth) and analyzed them for 29 physical, chemical, and
biological soil attributes. For selection of soil quality indicators,
principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the measured
attributes, which provided four principal components (PC) with
eigenvalues {\textgreater} 1 and explaining at least 5 {\%} of the variance in dataset.
The four PCs together explained 92.6 {\%} of the total variance. Based on
rotated factor loadings of soil attributes, selected indicators were:
soil organic carbon (SOC) from PC-1, exchangeable Al from PC-2, silt
content from PC-3, and available P and Mn from PC-4. Indicators were
transformed into scores (linear scoring method) and soil quality index
(SQI) was determined, on a scale of 0-1, using the weighting factors
obtained from PCA. SQI rating was the highest for the least-disturbed
sites, i.e., natural forestland (0.93) and grassland (0.87), and the
lowest for the most intensively cultivated site, i.e., cultivated upland
terrace (0.44). Ratings for the other land uses were shifting
cultivation (0.60) {\textgreater} cultivated low land (0.57) {\textgreater} plantation land
(0.54). Overall contribution (in percent) of the indicators in
determination of SQI was in the order: SOC (58 {\%}) {\textgreater} exch. Al (17.1 {\%})
{\textgreater} available P (8.9 {\%}) {\textgreater} available Mn (8.2 {\%}) {\textgreater} silt content (7.8 {\%}).
Results of this study suggest SOC and exch. Al as the two most powerful
indicators of soil quality in study area. Thus, organic C and soil
acidity management holds the key to improve soil quality under many
exploitatively cultivated land use systems in eastern Himalayan region
of India.},

critical component of the long-term sustainability and profitability of
rangelands (e. g., grazed grassland ecosystems) is the maintenance of
plant production. Amending grassland soils with organic waste has been
proposed as a means to increase net primary productivity (NPP) and
ecosystem carbon (C) storage, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
from waste management. Few studies have evaluated the effects of
amendments on the C balance and greenhouse gas dynamics of grasslands.
We used field manipulations replicated within and across two rangelands
(a valley grassland and a coastal grassland) to determine the effects of
a single application of composted green waste amendments on NPP and
greenhouse gas emissions over three years. Amendments elevated total
soil respiration by 18{\%} +/- 4{\%} at both sites but had no effect on
nitrous oxide or methane emissions. Carbon losses were significantly
offset by greater and sustained plant production. Amendments stimulated
both above-and belowground NPP by 2.1 +/- 0.8 Mg C/ha to 4.7 +/- 0.7 Mg
C/ha (mean +/- SE) over the three-year study period. Net ecosystem C
storage increased by 25-70{\%} without including the direct addition of
compost C. The estimated magnitude of net ecosystem C storage was
sensitive to estimates of heterotrophic soil respiration but was greater
than controls in five out of six fields that received amendments. The
sixth plot was the only one that exhibited lower soil moisture than the
control, suggesting an important role of water limitation in these
seasonally dry ecosystems. Treatment effects persisted over the course
of the study, which were likely derived from increased water-holding
capacity in most plots, and slow-release fertilization from compost
decomposition. We conclude that a single application of composted
organic matter can significantly increase grassland C storage, and that
effects of a single application are likely to carry over in time.},

investigate changes in soil hydraulic properties, geomorphology, and
vegetation and to collect data to support a revised design. Field data

subsequently included in a hydrologic modeling study to estimate the

decommissioning study showed that properties of the soils changed over
the monitoring period (saturated hydraulic conductivity and water
holding capacity increased, density decreased) and that the perennial

species with shallower roots and lesser capacity for water uptake. Of
these changes, reduced ET from the shallow-rooted annual vegetation is
believed to be the primary cause for the high percolation rate from the

grazing increased forb cover, native forb species richness, and overall
plant diversity. At the midspring grazing timing, medusahead was in the

success of this timely grazing system required high animal densities for

abstract = {1 Local abiotic factors are likely to play a crucial role in modifying
the relative abundance of native and exotic species in plant
communities. Natural gradients provide an ideal opportunity to test this
hypothesis.
2 In a coastal dune system in northern California, we used comparative
and experimental studies to evaluate how a wind and soil texture
gradient influences the relative abundance of native and exotic plant
species in this community.
3 We detected small-scale spatial variation in soil texture along a
200-m gradient from relatively sheltered to more exposed. Sand
coarseness significantly increased with exposure while soil nitrate
levels significantly decreased. The more extreme end of the gradient was
also subject to greater wind speeds and less soil moisture.
4 The plant community consistently responded to this gradient in the 7
years censused. Species richness decreased with exposure, cover of
natives decreased and cover of exotics increased at the more extreme end
of the gradient.
5 A single-season wind-shelter experiment similarly shifted the balance
between native and exotic species. Shelters decreased the relative
density of exotic species and increased the relative density of natives
regardless of position on the gradient.
6 These comparative and manipulative findings both suggest that a single
factor, wind, at least partially explains the success of exotic species
in a coastal dune plant community. This supports the hypothesis that
local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within
a plant community.},

examined the effect of distance from roads and its interactions with
soil type, aspect, and livestock grazing on native- and exotic-plant
diversity in a 130 000-ha inland California (USA) foothill grassland
landscape. During spring 2000 and-2001, we measured the numbers of and
cover by native and exotic plant species in 92 sites stratified by
distance from toads (10 in, 100 in, and {\textgreater} 1000 in), soil type
(nonserpentine and serpentine), and aspect (cool, warm, and neutral
slopes). In nonserpentine grasslands, native cover was greatest in sites
{\textgreater}1000 m-from roads (23{\%}) and least in sites 10 in from roads (0{\%}), and
the percentage of species that were native was significantly greatest in
sites {\textgreater} 1000 in from roads (44{\%}) and least in those 10 in from roads
(32{\%}). In addition, the most distant sites had the largest number of
native grass species and the fewest exotic forb species. In serpentine
grasslands there was no significant effect of distance from roads on the
numbers of and cover by native and exotic species. On both soils, two
exotic species (Centaurea solstitialis and Aegilops triuncialis) were at
their lowest frequencies, while a native bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra,
was at its highest frequency, in sites {\textgreater} 1000 m. from roads. On
nonserpentine soils only, the exotics, Convolvulus arvensis and
Polypogon monspeliensis, were at their lowest frequency, while a native
bunchgrass, Poa secunda, was at its highest frequency in the most
distant sites. Native species were more abundant on serpentine than
nonserpentine soils; on serpentine, natives were more abundant on slopes
than flat sites, while on nonserpentine, natives were least abundant on
warm, south-facing slopes.
Grazing, soil type, and aspect all, significantly interacted in their
effects on native and exotic richness and cover. Grazing negatively
affected the number of native grass species, but not the number of
native forb species on nonserpentine, and positively affected the
number,of native forb species, but not the number of native grass
species on serpentine.
Roadless areas are significant refuges for native species. However, to
protect these habitats from the continued threat of invasion, land
managers should consider means of preventing construction of new roads,
limiting off-highway vehicle access into grasslands with low road
densities, identifying a regime of livestock grazing that favors the
persistence of natives over the spread of exotics, and monitoring
recreational trails and grazing allotments within roadless areas to
detect and eradicate new infestations.},

Two sites near the head of the slough receive direct runoff from

receive direct runoff from grasslands and woodlands. Sites receiving
agricultural runoff usually had high water column concentrations of
dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll a (50 muM and 30 mug l(-1),
respectively). High precipitation in the winter of 1998 caused low
salinities in the slough at that time. In general, salinity and nutrient
concentrations were inversely correlated, Sites receiving agricultural
runoff had high pore water NH4+, DIP and dissolved S2- concentrations,
particularly in the summer, Oxygen penetration into sediments was the
greatest at the sites adjacent to grasslands and woodlands, and least at
the sites receiving high nutrient runoff. Sediment oxygen consumption
was 4 times greater at sites near agricultural fields than the site near
the mouth, while NH4+ flux out of sediments was between 4 and 20 times
greater at agricultural sites than at non-agricultural sites, This study
suggests that high nutrient runoff has primarily a local rather than

grazing removal may increase the relative importance of this N-loss

grazing treatments suggesting that N2O losses were related to
differences in NO3- availability rather than grazing effects on
microbial community composition or their activity. Spring-fed wetlands
provide important ecosystem services such as plant uptake and

abstract = {Rainfall is a key determinant of production and composition in arid and
semi-arid systems. Longterm studies relating composition and water
availability primarily focus on current-year precipitation patterns,
though mounting evidence highlights the importance of previous-year
rainfall particularly in grasslands dominated by perennial species. The
extent to which lagged precipitation effects occur in annual grasslands,
however, remains largely unexplored.
We pair a long-term study with two manipulative experiments to identify
patterns and mechanisms of lagged precipitation effects in annual
grasslands. The long-term study captured variation in functional group
(exotic annual forbs and grasses) abundance and precipitation across 8
years at three northern California grassland sites. We then tested
whether lagged rainfall effects were created through seed production and
litter (residual dry matter, RDM) by manipulating rainfall and litter,
respectively.
Rainfall from the previous-year growing season (both seasonal and total
rainfall) shifted functional group abundance. High lagged rainfall was
associated with increased grass and decreased forb abundance the
following year. Current-year seasonal rainfall also influenced species
composition, with winter rain increasing forb and decreasing grass
abundance. Lagged precipitation effects were generally stronger for
forbs than for grasses. Our experimental studies provided evidence for
two mechanisms that contributed to lagged effects in annual grasslands.
Higher rainfall increased seed production for grasses, which translated
to more germinable seed the following year. Higher rainfall also
increased biomass production and RDM, which benefited grasses and
reduced forb abundance.
Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of previous-year
precipitation in structuring annual community composition and suggest
two important biotic pathways, seed rain and RDM, that regulate lagged
community responses to rainfall. Incorporating lagged effects into
models of grassland diversity and productivity could improve predictions
of climate change impacts in annual grasslands.},

Valley of California. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates
salinity discharges from non-point sources to the San Joaquin River
using a procedure known as the total maximum daily load (TMDL) to
allocate the assimilative capacity of the river for salt among watershed
sources. Management of wetland sources of salt load will require the
development of monitoring systems, more integrative management
strategies and coordination with other entities. To obtain local
cooperation, the Grassland Water District (GWD), whose primary function
is to supply surface water to private duck clubs and manage wetlands,
needs to communicate to local landowners the likely impacts of salinity
regulation on the long-term health and function of wildfowl habitat. The
project described in this paper will also provide this information. The
models that form the backbone of the DSS, develop salinity balances at
both a regional and local scale. The regional scale concentrates on
deliveries to and exports from the GWD while the local scale focuses on
an individual wetland unit where more intensive monitoring is being
conducted. The design of the DSS is constrained to meet the needs of

beta diversity along a soil fertility gradient, we asked which
combinations of nutrient enrichment, precipitation enhancement and

dominant species from one part of the gradient to increase their
abundances in other parts of the gradient. In particular, joint addition
of nutrients and water might especially benefit resource-acquisitive

Fertilization and water addition allowed species from fertile soils to
increase their abundance in infertile soils, an effect that strengthened
with time. Disturbance permitted species from infertile soils to
increase in abundance in infertile soils, but only transiently. Plant
height, specific leaf area and exotic status best predicted the
abilities of species to attain greater cover in harsh habitats under
ameliorated conditions. Among-habitat beta diversity of seeded species

planted in single functional group (SFG) treatments, and in two-,
three-, and four-way combinations of functional groups. We analyzed
available nutrient pool sizes, microbial biomass nitrogen and
phosphorus, microbial nitrogen immobilization, nitrification rates, and
leaching losses.
We used an index of ``relative resource use{\{}''{\}} that incorporates the
effects of plants on pool sizes of several depletable soil resources:
inorganic nitrogen in all seasons, available phosphorus in all seasons,
and water in the summer dry season. We found a significant positive
relationship between increasing relative resource use (including both
plant and microbial uptake) and increasing plant diversity. The increase
in relative resource use results because different functional groups
have their maximum effect on different resources in different seasons:
E's dominate reduction of inorganic nitrogen pools in winter; L's have a
stronger depletion of nitrogen in spring and a dominant reduction of
water in summer; P's have a stronger nitrogen depletion in summer;
N-fixers provide additional nitrogen in all seasons and have a
significant phosphorus depletion in all seasons except fall. Single
functional group treatments varied greatly in relative resource use; for
example, the resource use index for the L treatment is as high as in the
more diverse treatments.
We expected a reduction of leaching losses as functional group richness
increased because of differences in rooting depth and seasonal activity
among these groups. However, measurements of nitrate in soil water
leached below the rooting zone indicated that, apart from a strong
reduction in losses in all vegetated treatments compared to the bare
treatment, there were no effects of increasing plant diversity. While
some single functional group treatments differed (P less than or equal
to L, N), more diverse treatments did not. Early-and late-season
annuals, but not perennial bunchgrasses, had significant positive
effects on microbial immobilization of nitrogen in short-term (24 h)
N-15 experiments.
We conclude that: (1) total resource use, across many resource axes and
including both plant and microbial effects, does increase with
increasing plant diversity on a yearly timescale due to seasonal
complementarity; (2) while the presence of vegetation has a large effect
on ecosystem nitrogen retention, nitrogen leaching losses do not
necessarily decrease with increasing functional group richness; (3)
indirect effects of plants on microbial processes such as immobilization
can equal or exceed direct effects of plant uptake on nutrient
retention; and (4) plant composition (i.e., the identity of the groups
present in treatments) in general explains much more about the measured
nutrient cycling processes than does functional group richness alone
(i.e., the number of groups present).},

for the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. Since increased climate
variability is expected to favour the invasive success of exotic
species, we conducted a field experiment to study the effects that
simulated rainy ENSO events in combination with herbivores and shade
have on the composition of a semiarid herbaceous community in
north-central Chile. We hypothesized that water pulses, such as those
associated with rainy ENSO events could trigger significant changes in
the relative abundance of exotic and native herbaceous species.
Specifically, we predicted an increase in native grasses and a reduction
in the abundance of exotic species, especially prostrate forbs, if water
pulses were combined with reduced herbivory. We found that herbivory by
small mammals, especially introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus
cuniculus) and hares (Lepus europaeus), have an overwhelming effect on
species abundance and composition in this semiarid herbaceous community.
Herbivore exclusion produced an overall increase in herb density and
biomass mostly due to the extraordinary growth of tall native grasses
(especially Bromus berterianus) that outcompeted small prostrate forbs
(both native and exotic ones), and small exotic grasses (Koeleria
pleoides, Schismus arabicus). Our results suggest that it might be
possible to enhance the recovery of native grasses by applying efficient
herbivore control during rainy years such as those associated with ENSO
events although a negative consequence would be the loss of small native
forbs, which greatly contribute to the richness of herbaceous
communities in semiarid ecosystems.},

although species diversity (independent of functional diversity) did not
affect the success of the invader, the invader suppressed growth of
species-poor communities more strongly. Invasion of Centaurea also
increased summer evapotranspiration in species-poor communities. These
results suggest that loss of species diversity alone does not affect

planting and dry matter production by two harvests per growing season.
Drilling rose clover in an undisturbed or desiccated sod or broadcasting

linear (P {\textless} 0.01). A seeding rate of 12 lb/acre was an acceptable

studied at the jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, a well-studied
California rangeland ecosystem. Here we review these studies, from leaf
to landscape scales, with the intention of developing a deeper
understanding of carbon (C)-nutrient interactions in such an ecosystem.
At the leaf scale, several studies conducted on diverse plant species
have revealed a strong positive relationship between leaf nitrogen (N)
concentrations and maximal rates of photosynthesis. This relationship,
which has subsequently been observed globally, can be explained by the
nutritional requirements of photosynthetic machinery. Consistent with
this local physiological constraint, N availability has been shown to
limit carbon uptake of California rangeland ecosystems. In some cases
phosphorus (P; and N plus P) limits productivity, too-particularly in
serpentine soils, pointing to the importance of parent material in
regulating CO2 uptake at landscape scales. Nutrient dynamics are also
affected by herbivory, which seems to accelerate N and P cycles over the
short term (years), but may lead to nutrient limitation of plant
production over the longer term (decades). Simulated global change
experiments at jasper Ridge have also provided insight into C-nutrient
interactions in grasslands. In particular, several field-based
experiments have shown that CO2 doubling does not necessarily simulate
productivity of California grasslands; rather, the strength and sign of
net primary productivity (NPP) responses to CO2 doubling varies across
years and conditions. Although simulated N deposition stimulates NPP, N
plus CO2 combinations do not necessarily increase productivity beyond N
treatments singly. Poorly understood feedbacks between plants, microbes,
and P availability may underlie variation in the response of California
grasslands to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We conclude
that interactions between C, N, and P appear especially vital in shaping
plant productivity patterns in California rangelands and the capacity of
this ecosystem to store additional C in the future.},

agricultural or grassland ecosystems. To date, little information is
available on the rate and nature of OM eroded from forest ecosystems. We
present annual sediment composition and yield, for water years
2005-2011, from eight catchments in the southern part of the Sierra
Nevada, California. Sediment was compared to soil at three different
landform positions from the source slopes to determine if there is
selective transport of organic matter or different mineral particle size
classes. Sediment export varied from 0.4 to 177 kg ha(-1), while export
of C in sediment was between 0.025 and 4.2 kg C ha(-1) and export of N
in sediment was between 0.001 and 0.04 kg N ha(-1). Sediment yield and
composition showed high interannual variation. In our study catchments,
erosion laterally mobilized OM-rich litter material and topsoil, some of
which enters streams owing to the catchment topography where steep
slopes border stream channels. Annual lateral sediment export was
positively and strongly correlated with stream discharge, while C and N
concentrations were both negatively correlated with stream discharge;
hence, C : N ratios were not strongly correlated to sediment yield. Our
results suggest that stream discharge, more than sediment source, is a
primary factor controlling the magnitude of C and N export from upland
forest catchments. The OM-rich nature of eroded sediment raises
important questions about the fate of the eroded OM. If a large fraction
of the soil organic matter (SOM) eroded from forest ecosystems is lost
during transport or after deposition, the contribution of forest
ecosystems to the erosion-induced C sink is likely to be small (compared
to croplands and grass-lands).},

abundance and diversity and are important areas for livestock grazing,
although grazing contributes to the degradation of riparian vegetation.
Complete removal of livestock is generally the most beneficial for bird
communities, but alternative management approaches allowing for seasonal
livestock grazing may also increase avian habitat quality. Determining
management approaches that integrate conservation priorities and human
use has the potential to improve conditions for birds across many grazed
landscapes. We anticipated that both the full and seasonal exclusion of
cattle from riparian areas would result in the recovery of avian
populations. To test this, we experimentally compared the effects of
total cattle exclusion vs. seasonal usage on bird populations in the
riparian areas of two creeks in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA.
Avian species richness and average abundance were measured over six
years, from 2001 to 2006. In general, native avian abundance and
richness increased in both full-and seasonal-exclosure areas, with
increases compared to the pretreatment year for all years except 2005.
Habitats that had complete cattle exclusion recovered more
significantly, with 29{\%} lower avian abundance in seasonally grazed
habitats. There was no significant difference in avian richness between
the two grazing treatments, although richness did increase over time. In
addition to increases in native species, abundance of nonnative birds
and brood parasites also increased significantly, with a greater avian
abundance in the full-exclusion areas. A direct comparison with the
Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), to further investigate annual avian
population trends, explained the native species decline in 2005. This
comparison revealed that observed trends were the effect of experimental
treatment rather than a reflection of regional trends. Although the
overall trends indicate that the full exclusion of livestock from
riparian areas results in more abundant bird populations, seasonal
exclusion is also a successful method for avian recovery. Land managers
should consider both options in riparian areas, selecting full cattle
removal for avian management only and seasonal cattle removal for
situations where incorporating conservation and land use practices is
advantageous.},

in California provides an important opportunity to examine drought
response across ecosystem classes (forests, shrublands, grasslands, and

ecosystem structure and function. We quantified ecosystem resistance to
drought by comparing changes in satellite-derived estimates of water-use
efficiency (WUE = net primary productivity {\{}[{\}}NPP]/evapotranspiration
{\{}[{\}}ET]) under normal (i.e., baseline) and drought conditions (Delta WUE
= WUE2014 - baseline WUE). With this method, areas with increasing WUE
under drought conditions are considered more resilient than systems with
declining WUE. Baseline WUE varied across California (0.08 to 3.85 g
C/mm H2O) and WUE generally increased under severe drought conditions in
2014. Strong correlations between Delta WUE, precipitation, and leaf
area index (LAI) indicate that ecosystems with a lower average LAI
(i.e., grasslands) also had greater C-uptake rates when water was
limiting and higher rates of carbon-uptake efficiency (CUE = NPP/LAI)
under drought conditions. We also found that systems with a baseline WUE
{\textless}= 0.4 exhibited a decline in WUE under drought conditions, suggesting
that a baseline WUE {\textless}= 0.4 might be indicative of low drought
resistance. Drought severity, precipitation, and WUE were identified as
important drivers of shifts in ecosystem classes over the study period.
These findings have important implications for understanding climate

woodlands. In a remnant invaded by exotic annuals, we applied three plot
treatments (carbon supplements, annual spring burns and untreated
control) and two seed treatments (+/- A Themeda seed) in a replicated,
factorial design. Within 3 years, successful establishment of Themeda
swards on burnt and carbon-supplemented plots was associated with a
reduction in soil nitrate to levels comparable with non-invaded,
Themeda-dominated reference sites in the region ({\textless} 3 mg/kg), and
significantly reduced exotic cover compared with unseeded plots. By
contrast, on plots not seeded with Themeda, soil nitrate increased after
cessation of carbon addition and exotic cover returned to levels
comparable with untreated control plots, despite a high cover of other
native perennial grasses. Few persistent effects of carbon supplements
or spring burning on soil nutrients were evident 9-19 months after
cessation of these treatments. Results suggest that Themeda is a
keystone species that regulates nitrate cycling, thereby imparting
ecological resistance to invasion by nitrophilic annuals.},

abstract = {Microbial transformations of nitrogen (N) largely determine whether N is
retained in ecosystems via net primary productivity or lost via gaseous
emissions and leaching. The controls on soil N cycling are often studied
at single locales, making it difficult to predict N cycling at regional

exhibit consistent relationships with instantaneous gross N cycling
rates across diverse biomes that create a continuum in these properties.
We measured ex situ gross N cycling rates and soil properties at 33
study sites representing five biome classifications in California
including deserts, grasslands, shrublands, forest, and wetlands. Desert
soils had significantly lower total N, organic carbon (C), microbial
biomass N, and soil moisture as well as higher pH than all other biomes,
whereas forests and wetlands had significantly lower soil nitrate (NO3
(-)) concentrations (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). Gross mineralization rates were
best predicted by the combination of soil moisture and soil C:N ratios
(R-2 = 0.46), which exerted positive and negative controls,
respectively. Grasslands exhibited marginally higher gross
mineralization than all other biomes, whereas deserts had the lowest
rates due to low soil moisture (P = 0.09). Gross nitrification rates
were positively correlated to soil NO3 concentrations (R-2 = 0.34) and
negatively correlated to soil C:N ratios (R2 = 0.31). The negative
relationship between gross nitrification and soil C:N ratios was driven
by forest soils, which had significantly higher C:N ratios and lower
gross nitrification than all other biomes (P {\textless} 0.05). Dissimilatory NOy
reduction to NH4- (DNRA) occurred in soils from all biomes. The strong
positive correlation between DNRA rates and soil NO3- (R-2 = 0.41)
suggests NO3- limitation of DNRA. Predictable patterns in gross N
cycling across biomes in California suggest that contemporary soil
properties are important drivers of instantaneous soil N cycling rates
that integrate over differences in vegetation type, atmospheric N
deposition rates, and local climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Microbial activity was consistent with microbial abundance; microbial
communities in non-native-cultivated, ex-arable soils were slow to

non-native plants maintain these conditions. Potential mechanisms

mitigation of anthropogenic changes that have altered resource
availability, grazing regimes, and community composition. In California
(USA), high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have
facilitated the invasion of exotic grasses, posing a threat to the
diverse plant and insect communities endemic to serpentine grasslands.
Cattle grazing has been employed to mitigate the consequences of exotic
grass invasion, but the ecological effects of grazing in this system are
not fully understood. To characterize the effects of realistic N
deposition on serpentine plant communities and to evaluate the efficacy
of grazing as a management tool, we performed a factorial experiment
adding N and excluding large herbivores in California's largest
serpentine grassland. Although we observed significant interannual
variation in community composition related to climate in our six-year
study, exotic cover was consistently and negatively correlated with
native plant richness. Sustained low-level N addition did not influence
plant community composition, but grazing reduced grass abundance while
maintaining greater native forb cover, native plant diversity, and
species richness in comparison to plots excluding large herbivores.
Furthermore, grazing increased the temporal stability of plant
communities by decreasing year-to-year variation in native forb cover,
native plant diversity, and native species richness. Taken together, our
findings demonstrate that moderate-intensity cattle grazing can be used
to restrict the invasive potential of exotic grasses and maintain native
plant communities in serpentine grasslands. We hypothesize that the
reduced temporal variability in serpentine plant communities managed by
grazing may directly benefit populations of the threatened Edith's Bay

abstract = {This study was designed to identify potential effects of elevated CO2 on
belowground respiration (the sum of root and heterotrophic respiration)
in field and microcosm ecosystems and on the annual carbon budget. We
made three sets of respiration measurements in two CO2 treatments, i.e.,
(1) monthly in the sandstone grassland and in microcosms from November
1993 to June 1994; (2) at the annual peak of live biomass (March and
April) in the serpentine and sandstone grasslands in 1993 and 1994; and
(3) at peak biomass in the microcosms with monocultures of seven species
in 1993. To help understand ecosystem carbon cycling, we also made
supplementary measurements of belowground respiration monthly in
sandstone and serpentine grasslands located within 500 m of the CO2
experiment site. The seasonal average respiration rate in the sandstone
grassland was 2.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in elevated CO2, which was 32{\%}
higher than the 1.49 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) measured in ambient CO2 (P =
0.007). Studies of seven individual species in the microcosms indicated
that respiration was positively correlated with plant biomass and
increased, on average, by 70{\%} with CO2. Monthly measurements revealed a
strong seasonality in belowground respiration, being low (0-0.5 mu mol
CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the two grasslands adjacent to the CO2 site) in the
summer dry season and high (2-4 mu mol CO2 m(-1) s(-1) in the sandstone
grassland and 2-7 mu mol CO2 m(-1) s(-1) in the microcosms) during the
growing season from the onset of fall rains in November to early spring
in April and May. Estimated annual carbon effluxes from the soil were
323 and 440 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the sandstone grasslands in ambient
and elevated CO2. That CO2-stimulated increase in annual soil carbon
efflux is more than twice as big as the increase in aboveground net
primary productivity (NPPa) and approximately 60{\%} of NPPa in this
grassland in the current CO2 environment. The results of this study
suggest that below-ground respiration can dissipate most of the increase
in photosynthesis stimulated by elevated CO2.},

abstract = {Grassland and prairie restoration projects in California often result in
long-term establishment of only a few native plant species, even when
they begin with a diverse seed palette. One explanation for the
disappearance of certain native species over time is that they are
excluded through competition. If so, management that reduces
interspecific competition may favor ``subordinate'' natives and promote
greater native species diversity in restored communities. Potential
management approaches to accomplish this goal include intraspecific
spatial aggregation during seeding and prescribed fire. However, no
studies have experimentally evaluated the effects of fire on a
controlled (restoration) species pool or the interaction between fire
and spatial aggregation. In a previous California prairie restoration
experiment, we demonstrated that aggregated plantings protected
competitively subordinate species from exclusion and increased community
diversity for three years. However, native species richness declined
throughout the study, and the benefits of aggregated seeding had begun
to disappear by the third year. For the present study, we resurveyed the
experimental plots five years after seeding and in the following year
carried out controlled burns on half of the plots. The four subordinate
species and one of the previously dominant species continued to decline
and essentially disappeared aboveground during years four and five.
However, burning in year five decreased the cover of dominant natives,
triggered the reappearance of the three subordinate species that had
disappeared or nearly disappeared in previous years, and increased
diversity of the restored community. Seeding treatments (aggregated or
interspersed) did not significantly affect community-level responses to
the burning treatment. These results confirm that although initial
intraspecific aggregation may promote species coexistence in the short
term, re-establishing disturbance regimes can allow coexistence over a
longer time scale by revealing and potentially renewing seed bank
diversity.},

abstract = {Winter non-leguminous cover crops are included in crop rotations to
decrease nitrate (NO3-N) leaching and increase soil organic matter. 
This study examined the effect of incorporating a mature cover crop on
subsequent N transformations. A field trial containing a winter cover
crop of Merced rye and a fallow control was established in December 1991
in Salinas, California. The rye was grown for 16 weeks, so that plants
had headed and were senescing, resulting in residue which was difficult
to incorporate and slow to decompose. Frequent sampling of the surface
soil (0-15 cm) showed that net mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation)
rapidly increased, then decreased shortly after tillage in both
treatments, but that sustained increases in net mineralizable N and
microbial biomass N in the cover-cropped soils did not occur until after
irrigation, 20 days after incorporation. Soil NO3-N was significantly
reduced compared to winter-fallow soil at that time. A N-15 experiment
examined the fate of N fertilizer, applied in cylinders at a rate of 12
kg N-15/ha at lettuce planting, and measured in the soil, microbial
biomass and lettuce plants after 32 days. In the cover-cropped soil,
59{\%} of the N-15 was recovered in the microbial biomass, compared to
21{\%} in the winter-bare soil. The dry weight, total N and N-15 content
of the lettuce in the cover-cropped cylinders were significantly lower;
28 v. 39{\%} of applied N-15 was recovered in the lettuce in the
cover-cropped and winter-bare soils, respectively. At harvest, the N
content of the lettuce in the cover-cropped soil remained lower, and
microbial biomass N was higher than in winter-bare soils. These data
indicate that delayed cover crop incorporation resulted in net microbial
immobilization which extended into the period of high crop demand and
reduced N availability to the crop.},

ecology that enable improved predictions of how the composition of plant
communities will respond to changes in environmental conditions. Plant
functional traits can be used to guide the restoration of degraded
habitats by closely tailoring treatments to the local species pool. We
tested this approach in two heavily invaded coastal California
grasslands. We asked whether native plant abundance and plant community
trait composition respond to (1) experimental soil fertility reduction
in the form of twice-yearly carbon (C) amendments and (2) disturbance in
the form of mowing. We measured height, specific leaf area, leaf
thickness and leaf density from individuals of 39 species in the control
and C addition plots, and supplemented these trait values with database
information on growth form, lifespan, nitrogen-fixing ability and seed
mass.
Consistent with theoretical predictions, C addition favored short,
large-seeded and nitrogen-fixing species, while mowing benefitted short
species with high specific leaf area. However, native and exotic species
did not differ in any of the measured traits, and neither group
benefitted generally from the treatments. Carbon addition led to large
intraspecific trait shifts, with individuals in C addition plots having
smaller, denser leaves and shorter stature. Species' trait plasticity,
however, was not related to the community composition response to C
addition.
Our study indicates that trait-based ecology is sufficiently mature to
provide useful predictions in the realm of restoration ecology. Trait
screening at a site can help predict the success of a particular
restoration measure in that community.},

abstract = {The interaction of resource availability and disturbance can strongly
affect plant species richness and the spread of exotic plants. Several
ecological theories posit that disturbance mediates the
richness-reducing effects of increased competition as resource levels
rise. In the low-nutrient serpentine grasslands of the San Francisco Bay
Area, the fertilizing effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may
threaten native species by promoting nitrophilic exotic grasses.
Attempts to mitigate these N deposition effects have focused on cattle
grazing as a strategy to reduce exotic grass cover. We simulated
realistic N deposition increases with low-level fertilization,
manipulated grazing with fencing, and monitored grazing intensity using
camera traps in a 4 yr factorial experiment to assess the effects of
grazing and N deposition on several measures of native and exotic
species dynamics in California's largest serpentine grassland. Our
results suggest that native species diversity may increase slightly
under low-level N deposition with moderate grazing in this system.
However, grazing may not be effective at limiting exotic cover as N
accumulates in the future. Examination of treatment trajectories using
principal response curves indicated that responses to grazing might be
determined more by functional group (forb or grass) than origin (native
or exotic). Grazing intensity varied dramatically within the single
stocking rate used to manage this ecosystem. Given this variation and
the contrasting effects of grazing on different functional groups, more
targeted management may be required to improve conservation outcomes.},

abstract = {The botanical composition of the diet and species preference of grazing
goats in different physiological states were evaluated in the autumn and
winter seasons. The study was performed in a desert rangeland in the
northeast (NE) Mendoza region in Argentina. Food availability was
estimated from forage species cover. Rectal grab faecal samples were
collected from goats, and the botanical composition of the goat diet was
determined using a microhistological technique. Goat preferences for
each species consumed were calculated based on IvIev's index.
Nutritional composition and secondary compounds of forage species were
determined. Correlations between diet and availability; and between goat
preference and nutritional composition of forage species were also
estimated. The habitat consisted of a dominant woody stratum associated
with an herb stratum primarily composed of grasses. Goats in different
physiological states utilised a significantly higher proportion of woody
vegetation compared to grass (p{\textless}0.01). When grass availability was high
(autumn), the herb stratum was more utilised by pregnant and lactating
goats than by dry goats (p{\textless}0.05). In the winter, the diet of lactating
goats consisted of more Atriplex lampa compared to the diet of dry goats
(p{\textless}0.05), probably due to the high crude protein content of the plant.
Goats consumed forage species with highly variable total phenol and
tannin contents, which did not negatively affect selection. Correlations
between diet and availability were high in the winter for dry (r(s) =
0.88, p{\textless}0.02), pregnant (r(s)=0.93, p{\textless}0.01) and lactating goats
(r(s)=0.97, p{\textless}0.01) but were not significant in the autumn. A
significant correlation between preference and crude protein was shown
during the autumn season for pregnant and lactating goats (r(s)=0.6,
p{\textless}0.05). Forage availability was the main factor influencing diet
selection in this arid environment. When food availability was not a
limiting factor, goats selected a diet that most closely matched their
nutritional requirements. Physiological state modified nutrient
requirements and affected diet selection in that pregnant and lactating
goats selected forage species with high protein contents. (C) 2011

abstract = {Invasions have increased the size of regional species pools, but are
typically assumed to reduce native diversity. However, global-scale
tests of this assumption have been elusive because of the focus on
exotic species richness, rather than relative abundance. This is
problematic because low invader richness can indicate invasion
resistance by the native community or, alternatively, dominance by a
single exotic species. Here, we used a globally replicated study to
quantify relationships between exotic richness and abundance in
grass-dominated ecosystems in 13 countries on six continents, ranging
from salt marshes to alpine tundra. We tested effects of human land use,
native community diversity, herbivore pressure, and nutrient limitation
on exotic plant dominance. Despite its widespread use, exotic richness
was a poor proxy for exotic dominance at low exotic richness, because
sites that contained few exotic species ranged from relatively pristine
(low exotic richness and cover) to almost completely exotic-dominated
ones (low exotic richness but high exotic cover). Both exotic cover and
richness were predicted by native plant diversity (native grass
richness) and land use (distance to cultivation). Although climate was
important for predicting both exotic cover and richness, climatic
factors predicting cover (precipitation variability) differed from those
predicting richness (maximum temperature and mean temperature in the
wettest quarter). Herbivory and nutrient limitation did not predict
exotic richness or cover. Exotic dominance was greatest in areas with
low native grass richness at the site- or regional-scale. Although this
could reflect native grass displacement, a lack of biotic resistance is
a more likely explanation, given that grasses comprise the most
aggressive invaders. These findings underscore the need to move beyond
richness as a surrogate for the extent of invasion, because this metric
confounds monodominance with invasion resistance. Monitoring species'
relative abundance will more rapidly advance our understanding of
invasions.},

intensity, Foliar cover was recorded for individual plant species
regenerating by sprouting from older parts of plants that had survived
fire or by seedlings; records were made during the dry season and at the
beginning of the wet season. Data on bark thickness and tree diameters
of 12 dominant tree species were also recorded. Both facultative and
obligate sprouters significantly contributed to post-fire recovery,
comprising 98.5 {\%} of total vegetation cover. The contribution of
seedlings to cover and abundance immediately following fire was
negligible, but seedling density increased in the beginning of the rainy
season, 4 to 5 months after fire. The importance of the sprouting and
seeding strategies varied between the different plant growth forms. The
highest contribution to cover and frequency was made by the most
abundant grass species, which reproduced in both ways. Facultative
sprouters made up 67.3 {\%} of the vegetation cover, out of which 54 {\%}
consisted of grasses. Broad-leaved herbs and trees/shrubs regenerating
mainly by sprouting made up 31.3 {\%} of the vegetation cover. Adaptations
to fire in tree species seemed to in clude the development of a thick
bark, once the tree has passed seedling stages. Tree bark thickness and
tree diameter at breast height were strongly correlated with the time
taken for cambium to reach an assumed lethal temperature of 60degreesC
when exposed to fire, which indicated that mature trees with thick barks
might resist stronger fire better than, e.g., small or young trees and
trees with thin bark. However, for a given bark thickness the cambium
resistance to heat varied three-fold among species. Hence, site
differences in fire intensity seemed to influence the distribution of
trees depending on their bark characteristics and resistance to fire.},

abstract = {Greenhouse and field trials and nutritional studies are reviewed for
three halophytes that are candidate species for salt-water crop
production. Salicornia bigelovii is a leafless, C3, succulent annual
salt marsh plant that produces an oilseed on seawater irrigation in
coastal desert environments. Yields on seawater are similar to
conventional oilseeds under ideal conditions but are reduced under
mechanical harvest due to uneven seed ripening and shattering of seeds.
Water management requires frequent irrigation to keep the shallow-root
zone at field capacity and to ensure a leaching fraction to prevent
accumulation of salts. Nutritional value of oil, seed meal and biomass
are adequate to replace conventional animal feed ingredients in
formulated diets, despite presence of saponins in the meal and high salt
content of the biomass. A breeding program showed that this species is
amendable to improvement using conventional breeding approaches.
Atriplex lentiformis is a perennial C4 xerohalophyte shrub valued as a
forage species in North American rangelands. Under cultivation it
produces as much biomass and protein as alfalfa on salinities ranging
from mildly saline (1.8 g L-1 TDS) to full seawater salinity (40 g L-1).
Greenhouse trials show that salinity increases dry matter production and
water use efficiency of A. lentiformis on drying soils, making it a good
candidate for deficit irrigation for forage production. As with other
Atriplex spp., its crop potential is currently limited by a tendency to
become woody with successive cuts and with non-protein nitrogen and
anti-nutritional compounds present in leaves. Distichlis palmeri is a
perennial C4 saltgrass endemic to the delta of the Colorado River in the
northern Gulf of California that produces a grain similar in size and
nutrition composition to rice. It was a staple summer food source for
the Cocopa people before upstream water diversions disrupted flood flows
to the delta. It is productive on fullstrength seawater and produces
aerenchyma tissue allowing it to grow under flooded conditions similar
to paddy rice. However, only limited experiments have been conducted
with this plant, and therefore its ultimate agronomic potential is
unknown. Despite initial pessimism about the production potential of
halophytes, these examples show that euhalophytes can maintain high
productivity of useful agricultural products up to a root-zone salinity
of 70 g L-1 TDS, double the salinity of seawater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

the diversity and composition of natural communities. We followed
responses of an annual grassland to three years of all possible
combinations of experimentally elevated CO(2) (+300, muL/L), warming
(+80 W/m(2), + similar to1degreesC), nitrogen deposition (+7 g
N.m(-2).yr(-1)),and precipitation (+50{\%}). Responses of the 10 most
common plant species to global changes and to interannual variability
were weak but sufficiently consistent within functional groups to drive
clearer responses at the functional group level. The dominant functional
groups (annual grasses and forbs) showed distinct production and
abundance responses to individual global changes. After three years, N
deposition suppressed plant diversity, forb production, and forb
abundance in association with enhanced grass production. Elevated
precipitation enhanced plant diversity, forb production, and forb
abundance but affected grasses little. Warming increased forb production
and abundance but did not strongly affect diversity or grass response.
Elevated CO(2) reduced diversity with little effect on relative
abundance or production of forbs and grasses. Realistic combinations of
global changes had small diversity effects but more marked effects on
the relative dominance of forbs and grasses. The largest change in
relative functional group abundance (+50{\%} forbs) occurred under the
combination of elevated CO(2) + warming + precipitation, which will
likely affect much of California in the future. Strong interannual
variability in diversity, individual. species abundances, and functional
group abundances indicated that in our system, (1) responses after three
years were not constrained by lags in community response, (2) individual
species were more sensitive to interannual variability and extremes than
to mean changes in environmental and resource conditions, and (3)
simulated global changes interacted with interannual variability to
produce responses of varying magnitude and even direction among years.
Relative abundance of forbs, the most speciose group in the community,
ranged after three years from {\textgreater}30{\%} under elevated CO(2) + warming +
precipitation to {\textless}12{\%} under N deposition: While opposing production
responses at the ecosystem level by different functional groups may
buffet responses such as net primary production (NPP) change, these
shifts in relative dominance could influence ecosystem processes such as

Concurrently, landowners have significantly reduced the clearing of oaks

cutting of living oaks for any reason, reduced cutting of oaks for
fuelwood, increased use of oak promoting practices, and a growing
awareness of the need to be concerned about the status of oaks.
Landowners who were aware of the resource benefits of having oaks, or

abstract = {Nutrient limitation to net primary production (NPP) displays a diversity
of patterns as ecosystems develop over a range of timescales. For
example, some ecosystems transition from N limitation on young soils to
P limitation on geologically old soils, whereas others appear to remain
N limited. Under what conditions should N limitation and P limitation
prevail? When do transitions between N and P limitation occur? We
analyzed transient dynamics of multiple timescales in an ecosystem model
to investigate these questions. Post-disturbance dynamics in our model
are controlled by a cascade of rates, from plant uptake (very fast) to
litter turnover (fast) to plant mortality (intermediate) to
plant-unavailable nutrient loss (slow) to weathering (very slow). Young
ecosystems are N limited when symbiotic N fixation (SNF) is constrained
and P weathering inputs are high relative to atmospheric N deposition
and plant N: P demand, but P limited under opposite conditions. In the
absence of SNF, N limitation is likely to worsen through succession
(decades to centuries) because P is mineralized faster than N. Over long
timescales (centuries and longer) this preferential P mineralization
increases the N: P ratio of soil organic matter, leading to greater
losses of plant-unavailable N versus P relative to plant N: P demand.
These loss dynamics favor N limitation on older soils despite the rising
organic matter N: P ratio. However, weathering depletion favors P
limitation on older soils when continual P inputs (e. g., dust
deposition) are low, so nutrient limitation at the terminal equilibrium
depends on the balance of these input and loss effects. If NPP switches
from N to P limitation over long time periods, the transition time
depends most strongly on the P weathering rate. At all timescales SNF
has the capacity to overcome N limitation, so nutrient limitation
depends critically on limits to SNF.},

change following a large fire at Point Reyes National Seashore,
California, USA. Vegetation in the Point Reyes region is characterized
by a complex mosaic of grassland, shrub, and forest plant communities,
and by high levels of plant diversity. Although large fires are
relatively rare on the coast of California north of San Francisco Bay,
they are important in determining the distributions of plant communities
at the landscape scale. We mapped vegetation communities throughout the
study area using aerial imagery and analyzed how vegetation shifted
following fire. We found substantial areas had transitioned from coastal
scrub to ceanothus scrub (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus Eschsch.) or Bishop
pine (Pinus muricata D. Don) forest following fire. Transitions from
shrub to tree vegetation following fire have rarely been documented in
this region. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
factors influencing the post-fire distribution of Bishop pine and
ceanothus scrub. Proximity to pre-fire Bishop pine stands and pre-fire
vegetation type were the most important predictors of post-fire Bishop
pine regeneration. Pre-fire vegetation type, burn severity, and
topography were the most important predictors of post-fire ceanothus

ecosystems for substantial change over short time periods in response to

restoration efforts, but not all species within a target assemblage have
the same capacity for recruitment and survival in created habitats. We
investigated the development of a tidal salt marsh plant community in
the presence of a rapidly colonizing dominant species, Salicornia
virginica, in a newly created habitat in Mugu Lagoon, California, USA.
We planted rooted cuttings of S. virginica, Distichlis spicata, Jaumea
carnosa, and Frankenia salina in single- and mixed-species stands, where
each species was planted alone or in combination with S. virginica in 4
m 2 plots. We measured species percent cover, recruit density, canopy
structure, and aboveground biomass after three growing seasons. When
planted alone, S. virginica achieved the greatest cover, up to 70{\%},
followed by J. carnosa (55{\%}), F salina (35{\%}), and D. spicata (12{\%}).
Total percent cover was about 30{\%} lower than in a reference site. For
each species, average percent cover and aboveground biomass per plant
were generally similar between single-species and mixed planting
treatments, suggesting that on the time scale of this study, competition
between species was weak. Canopy structure (height, number of layers)
and total aboveground biomass of all species were largely unaffected by
planting treatments, although S. virginica was shorter when planted with
J. carnosa. Salicornia virginica recruits constituted approximately 98{\%}
of the cover of seedling recruits into the created site. Despite intense
S. virginica recruitment, our intervention in the successional process
by planting species with poorer colonization abilities, particularly J
carnosa and F. salina, prevented S. virginica from completely dominating
the canopy, thus increasing vascular plant richness in the created site.
Artificially increased richness may enhance some ecosystem functions and
create a seed source to facilitate the persistence of a diverse plant
assemblage in restored sites.},

by perennial species in the northern central states, similar evaluations

are generally composed of a high diversity of native and nonnative
annual species. In this study we monitored the effects of 53 and 123 g
ae aminopyralid ha(-1) on individual species cover and species richness
over three growing seasons in two locations on California annual
grassland. Treated plots were compared to untreated plots in randomized
complete-block designs. Results were largely consistent between the two

reduced dicot cover significantly, particularly members of the
Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Treated plots also showed reduced species
richness. However, these differences were less pronounced in the second
season after treatment, particularly at the low rate. By the third
season after treatment in both sites, there were no longer any
significant effects on cover or species richness at the low herbicide
rate. On California annual grasslands, winter applications of low rates
of aminopyralid have been shown to give excellent control of yellow

abstract = {Vegetation that becomes overtopped usually experiences a decrease in
abundance or species richness. When an overtopping plant alters the
physiognomy of the existing vegetation (e.g., trees invading a
shrubland), ecosystem processes can also be dramatically altered.
Worldwide, Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) cultivars have been planted in
Mediterranean-like climates and are known to invade surrounding natural
communities. Ecological impacts resulting from these invasions have been
widely investigated; however, the effects from solitary pine trees on
the vegetation they overtop are lacking. Furthermore, studies on the
impact of P. radiata cultivars from the California floristic province,
where P. radiata is native, do not exist. In coastal California, north
of the present-day range of native P. radiata stands, cultivars of this
species have invaded northern coastal scrub vegetation. To determine the
impact of pine invasion on species richness and structure in this
habitat, floristic surveys were conducted in 20 blocks that consisted of
invaded and uninvaded plots. An invaded plot contained two subplots
located under the canopy of an isolated pine tree, whereas a paired,
uninvaded plot contained two subplots located in coastal scrub adjacent
to each pine. Pine trees selected ranged in size from 2.8 to 119 cm (1.1
to 46.9 in) basal diameter. Our results demonstrate that understory
native cover and species richness are negatively correlated with tree
size. Understory exotic plant cover and richness of species other than
P. radiata did not show any correlation with tree size, mainly because
exotic plants had a very low abundance overall.},

referred to as the rapid increase in C-4 ecosystems (RICE), occurred in
the late Miocene in North America. While fossil plant specimens from the
Miocene Dove Spring Formation of California as well as data from
phylogenetic studies and molecular clocks show that C-4 grasses evolved
prior to the RICE, most isotopic data from paleosols and mammal tooth
enamel suggest that its abundance on the landscape was minimal. However,
a few recent studies from the Great Plains suggest that C-4 grasslands
may have been more prominent prior to the RICE event. Here we examine
stable carbon isotope values from ungulate tooth enamel from the Barstow
Formation of southern California, which is geographically and temporally
close to the Dove Spring Formation, and records a diverse and abundant
paleofauna of medial Miocene age. Tooth enamel delta C-13 values were
examined in seven ungulate genera including the hypsodont equids;
Acritohippus sp. and Scaphohippus sp.; the camelids, Aepycamelus sp.,
Hesperocamelus sp., and Procamelus sp.; the antilocaprid, Merycodus sp.;
and the proboscidean, Gomphotherium sp. More positive delta C-13 values
observed within the equids, camelids, and antilocaprids are suggestive
of C-4 grasses being included in the diets of these taxa. The equids
exhibited the most positive mean delta C-13 values, which indicate a
higher component of dietary C-4 grasses (up to 18{\%}) when compared to
the other sampled ungulate taxa. The tooth enamel isotope values
presented in this study show the presence of C-4 grasses as a
significant component of ungulate diets millions of years before the
RICE. The abundance of C-4 plants earlier in the Miocene may imply a
more significant role in the major ungulate diversification events than
previously suspected. The few pre-RICE localities showing evidence of
C-4 abundance suggests that these grasslands were geographically
restricted which limits, but may not exclude, the possibility that a
world-wide mechanism controlled its spread. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

reproductive effort and output among four species of passerine birds in
coastal southern California, USA, a semi-arid region, during a normal
precipitation year ( 2001) and the driest year in a 150-year climate
record ( 2002). Both reproductive effort and output differed
dramatically between years. Mean reproductive output among the four
species was 2.37. edglings/pair in 2001 and 88.4{\%} of all pairs observed
attempted at least one nest. The birds attempted a mean of 1.44 nests
per pair and were successful in 47.7{\%} of those attempts. In 2002, only
6.7{\%} of the pairs even attempted a nest and only 1.8{\%} were successful,
for a total output of 0.07 fledglings per pair. The abundance of
suitable arthropod prey items in the environment was also much lower in
2002, suggesting that low food availability was the proximal cause of
the reproductive failure. The data for one of these species, the
rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps), were combined with
reproductive and rainfall data from a previous 3-year study ( 1997 -
1999) in the same sites. The combined data sets suggest that the
response of reproduction to rainfall variation is linear, and that the
low end of the precipitation range brings the population near
reproductive failure. Any change in climate that would increase the
frequency of extreme dry conditions would likely endanger populations of
these species.},

eddy covariance measurements to investigate how soil moisture, rain
pulses, and growth alter the response of ecosystem respiration to
temperature. The data were acquired over an annual grassland and from
the grass understory of an oak/grass savanna ecosystem in California. We
observed that ecosystem respiration was an exponential function of soil
temperature during the winter wet season and a jump in ecosystem
respiration occurred, at comparable temperatures, during the spring
growth period. The depletion of the moisture from the soil reservoir,
during spring, limited ecosystem respiration after its volumetric water
content dropped below a threshold of 0.15 m(3) m(-3). The senescence of
grass during the summer switched the source of ecosystem respiration to
heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. During the summer, respiration
proceeded at a low basal rate (about 0.10 to 0.3 g C m(-2) d(-1)),
except when summer rain events stimulated large dynamic pulses in
heterotrophic respiration. Peak respiratory pulses were on the order of
60-80 times baseline and could not be explained by functions that depend
on mean soil moisture and temperature. We found that the magnitude of
the respiratory pulses was inversely related to its prerain value and
that the time constant, describing the exponential decay of the
respiratory pulses after the rain event, was a function of the amount of
rainfall. The amount of carbon lost, in association with a few summer
rain events, was greater at the site with higher primary productivity
and soil carbon content.},

governing the dynamics of nutrient limitation are poorly understood. In
particular, plant-available (e.g., nitrate) versus plant-unavailable
(e.g., dissolved organic nitrogen) nutrient losses may have
qualitatively different impacts on nutrient limitation. We examine
processes controlling equilibrium and transient nutrient dynamics at
three separate timescales in a model of a nutrient cycling through
plants and soil. When the only losses are from the plant-available
nutrient pool, nutrient limitation at a long-term equilibrium is
impossible under a wide class of conditions. However, plant biomass will
appear to level off on a timescale controlled by plant nutrient turnover
(years in grasslands, decades to centuries in forests), even though it
can grow slowly forever. Primary production can be nutrient limited in
the long-term when there are losses of plant-unavailable nutrients or
when the mineralization flux saturates with increasing detrital mass.
The long timescale required for soil nutrient buildup is set by the
plant-unavailable loss rate (centuries to millennia). The short
timescale (hours to days) at which available nutrients in the soil
equilibrate in the model is controlled by biotic uptake. These insights
into processes controlling different timescales in terrestrial
ecosystems can help guide empirical and experimental studies.},

modifying interactions among species. In this paper, we examined the
response of a semi-arid ecological community to a fivefold change in
precipitation over 7 years.
3. We examined the effects of precipitation on the dynamics of a
grassland ecosystem in central California from 2007 to 2013. We
conducted vegetation surveys, pitfall trapping of invertebrates, visual
surveys of lizards and capture-mark-recapture surveys of rodents on 30
plots each year. We used structural equation modelling to evaluate the
direct, indirect and modifying effects of precipitation on plants, ants,
beetles, orthopterans, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels and lizards.
4. We found pervasive effects of precipitation on the ecological
community. Although precipitation increased plant biomass, direct
effects on fauna were often stronger than plantmediated effects. In
addition, precipitation altered the sign or strength of
consumer-resource and facilitative interactions among the faunal
community such that negative or neutral interactions became positive or
vice versa with increasing precipitation.
5. These findings indicate that precipitation influences ecological
communities in multiple ways beyond its recognized effects on primary
productivity. Stochastic variation in precipitation may weaken the

trees and grazing animals (livestock vs. wild ungulates, mostly deer) on
biomass and diversity (and their relationship) of the herbaceous layer
(understory) of open holm oak woodland (known as dehesa) in Central
Spain, for two years. We located two 1-ha plots within three different
grazing management schemes (cattle, sheep and wildlife only). Within
each plot, we randomly selected four focal trees from which a subplot
was established in two directions and three distances. In each subplot,
we measured plant diversity and biomass, along with microclimatic
variables across sites. We found rainfall variability affected
herbaceous biomass and diversity in the dehesa system, and the effects
were nuanced: in a dry year ({\textless}300 mm annual rainfall) the presence of
livestock grazing correlated with higher herbaceous biomass (14{\%}), and
in moister year ({\textgreater}600 mm annual rainfall) the effect was enhanced, as
plots under livestock grazing exhibited even higher herbaceous biomass
(42{\%}). In addition, livestock, particularly cattle, generated a more
diverse community (52 species m(-2)). Microsites created by trees
generated high plant diversity among herbaceous communities, where alpha
diversity was higher (20{\%}) in ecotone and inter-tree gaps than under
the canopies. In addition, species turnover was higher than 50{\%} in all
cases. Biomass was higher (15{\%}) under the canopies only under humid
conditions. Legume dry matter was positively related to plant diversity.
We concluded that agro-forestry management practices such as promoting
tree development through silvicultural techniques to create different
microsites, and maintaining livestock grazing are needed to preserve
these emblematic ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

other terrestrial plant communities. In order to develop predictions of
plant community responses to changing environments, it is critical to
understand how factors structuring plant communities will be influenced

the size and abundance of gastropods to be altered by the individual and
combined effects of elevated atmospheric Co-2 and increased deposition
of N. Previous work suggests that responses of herbivore abundance to
these global changes seem likely to depend, in part, upon the changes in
the quantity of plant biomass available for consumption, and changes in
the nutritional quality of this plant material for gastropod survival,
development, and reproduction. Therefore, in this study we investigated
the effect of elevated Co-2 and increased N deposition on gastropod size

N status. Elevated Co-2 depressed the size of gastropods early in the

by 38{\%} to 43{\%}, and depressed abundance late in the growing season by
21{\%} to 29{\%}. These changes in gastropod size and abundance were due
largely to the modification of plant tissue quality and quantity.
Increased N deposition, in contrast, influenced neither gastropod
abundance nor per capita biomass during any part of the growing season.

investigated how cover of non-native species and soil-aggregate
stability (a measure of vulnerability to erosion by water) in surface

cattle and whether patterns in these variables changed after grazer
removal from Mojave National Preserve, California, USA. We compared
distance from water and number of ungulate defecations - metrics of
longer-term and recent grazing intensity, respectively, - as predictors
of our response variables. We used information-theoretic analyses to
compare hierarchical linear models that accounted for important
covariates and allowed for interannual variation in the
disturbance-response relationship at local and landscape scales. Soil
stability was greater under perennial vegetation than in bare
interspaces, and surface soil stability decreased with increasing
numbers of ungulate defecations. Stability of surface samples was more
affected by time since removal of grazers than was stability of
subsurface samples, and subsurface soil stability in bare spaces was not
related to grazing intensity, time since removal, or any of our other
predictors. In the high rainfall year (2003) after cattle had been
removed for 1-2 years, cover of all non-native plants averaged nine
times higher than in the low-rainfall year (2002). Given the

derived for oak tree growth on rangelands for stands with at least 50{\%}
of the total tree cover in blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook. {\&} Arn.)

estimated based on oak cover, weather variables, growing period, and

demographics, advertising, livestock density, and club size. The
interrelationship of these resource values is shown in output from an
optimal control model that incorporates these production functions. Oak
trees are gradually cleared for situations where cattle are the only
economic product, whereas a residual tree canopy is maintained for cases
where firewood and hunting enterprises are considered. In addition,
cattle stocking is higher and net profitability is lower for the cattle
only management scenario when compared with a multiple use management
scenario. The development of these multiple use production functions
allows the full range of resource management options to be considered.},

Southern California. The marsh was a net source of carbon over the

(NEP) variability was the largest that has been reported for any
terrestrial ecosystem and was attributed to changes in maximum
photosynthetic rates (GEE(max)). The variation in energy and mass
exchange was coupled between years; years with higher than average rates
of carbon uptake were associated with lower than average sensible heat
fluxes. Remotely sensed measures of surface greenness (EVI) were closely
related to GEEmax variation, providing further evidence of interannual
variability. We were unable to attribute the fluctuations in GEEmax to
the direct effects of weather on ecosystem physiology, or to interannual
variation in LAImax. GEE did not vary systematically with air
temperature or the presence of standing water in the marsh; GEEmax did
not vary with LAImax between years. Rather, interannual variation in
carbon exchange at the SJFM resulted from shifts in the marsh's
production efficiency (the rates of gross or net CO(2) exchange per LAI)

the assumptions that interannual variation of land-atmosphere exchange
is universally caused by the direct effect of weather on ecosystem

grassland bird species-Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), Horned
Lark (Eremophila alpestris), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus
savannarum)-at sites in central California during breeding season. In
California's Mediterranean-type climatic region, coastal and inland
grassland vegetation is dominated by exotic annual grasses with
occasional patches of native bunchgrass and forbs. Livestock grazing,
primarily with beef cattle, is the most widely used management tool.
Compared with ungrazed plots, grazed plots had higher bare ground,
native plant cover, and vertically heterogeneous vegetation. Grazed
plots also had less plant litter and shorter vegetation. Higher native
plant cover, which is predominantly composed of bunchgrasses in our
study area, was associated with livestock grazing and north-facing
aspects. Using an information theoretic approach, we found that all
three bird species had positive associations with native plant abundance
and neutral (Western Meadowlark, Grasshopper Sparrow) or positive
(Horned Lark) association with livestock grazing. All species favored
flatter areas. Horned Larks and Western Meadowlark occurred more often
where there were patches of bare ground. Western Meadowlarks and
Grasshopper Sparrows were most common on north-facing slopes, suggesting
that these species may be at risk from projected climate change. These
findings demonstrate that livestock grazing is compatible with or
supports grassland bird conservation in Mediterranean-type grasslands,
including areas with high levels of exotic annual grass invasion, in
part because grazing supports the persistence of native plants and
heterogeneity in vegetation structure. However, conservation of
low-lying grasslands with high native species presence, and active
management to increase the abundance of native plant species are also
likely to be important for sustaining grassland birds long-term.},

unclear, however, whether this relationship is robust across spatial
scales, and how a disturbance regime may affect it. Here, I examine the
relationships of both richness and abundance between native and
naturalized species of plants in two mediterranean scrub communities:
coastal sage scrub (CSS) in California and xeric-sloped matorral (XSM)
in Chile. In each vegetation type I surveyed multiple sites, where I
identified vascular plant species and estimated their relative cover.
Herbaceous species richness was higher in XSM, while cover of woody
species was higher in CSS, where woody species have a strong impact upon
herbaceous species. As there were few naturalized species with a woody
growth form, the analyses performed here relate primarily to herbaceous
species. Relationships between the herbaceous cover of native and
naturalized species were not significant in CSS, but were nearly
significant in XSM. The herbaceous species richness of native and
naturalized plants were not significantly correlated on sites that had
burned less than one year prior to sampling in CSS, and too few sites
were available to examine this relationship in XSM. In post 1-year burn
sites, however, herbaceous richness of native and naturalized species
were positively correlated in both CSS and XSM. This relationship
occurred at all spatial scales, from 400 m(2) to 1 m(2) plots. The
consistency of this relationship in this study, together with its
reported occurrence in the literature, suggests that this relationship
may be general. Finally, the residuals from the correlations between
native and naturalized species richness and cover, when plotted against
site age (i.e. time since the last fire), show that richness and cover
of naturalized species are strongly favoured on recently burned sites in
XSM; this suggests that herbaceous species native to Chile are

The vegetation structure of the coastal sage scrub ecosystems in
southern California is shifting from shrubland to annual grasslands.
Over the last 30 years large tracts of wildlands, particularly those
adjacent to urban centers, have lost significant native shrub cover,
which has been replaced by exotic annuals native to the Mediterranean
Basin. During this same time, air pollution has led to increased
terrestrial eutrophication by atmospheric deposition. Changes in
vegetation are often the result of changes in resource availability. The
results of our experiments showed the three native shrubs tested to be
more nitrophilous than the three annuals tested, which contrasts with
most models of perennial species' adaptation to stressful environments.
Under greenhouse conditions the annual grasses exhibited yield
depression at the highest N treatments of 80 mu g g(-1) in soil. The
three shrub species evaluated continued to increase shoot biomass at 80
mu g g(-1) N in soil. The grasses also exhibited increased tissue N
concentrations with increased soil N in contrast with the shrubs where
there was little difference in tissue N concentrations with increasing
availability. Although the differential yield responses to elevated N do
not explain the success of the annual vegetation in replacing shrubs,
the inability of the shrubs to regulate growth under elevated N levels
may explain the poor survival of mature individuals.},

of the Mediterranean climates of the western United States differ in
their life history strategies from the well-studied perennial grasslands
of other regions and thus may also differ in their soil C pools and
fluxes. In this study we use the literature to explore patterns in soil
C storage in annual grass-dominated rangelands in California. We show
that soil C is highly predictable with depth. Cumulative soil C content
increased to 2-3-m depth in rangelands with a woody component and to at
least 1-m depth in open rangelands. Soil C within a given depth varied
widely, with C content in the top 1-m depth spanning almost 200 Mg C .
ha(-1) across sites. Soil C pools were not correlated with temperature
or precipitation at a regional scale. The presence of woody plants
increased C by an average of 40 Mg . ha(-1) in the top meter of soil.
Grazed annual grasslands had similar soil C content as ungrazed
grassland at all depths examined, although few details on grazing
management were available. Soil C pools were weakly positively

impact of human development on stream water quality was evident as both
agricultural area and population density predicted TSS loading in a
linear mixed effects model. In contrast to the TSS model, the nitrate-N
loading model was more complex with agriculture, grassland, and the
presence or absence of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) all
contributing. The lack of correlation between population density and
nitrate-N loading indicates that human habitation of the landscape does
not impact stream nitrate levels until a WWTP is built within the
sub-basin. During dry water years the models predict a linear reduction
in TSS loading but the correlations to agriculture and population
density remain positive. In contrast, nitrate is positively correlated
to grasslands during average water years and negatively correlated
during dry water years. Analysis of constituent fluxes from the upper
watershed versus the lower watershed indicates that silica is derived
primarily from the uplands and that during dry water years the upper
watershed is an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and

cattle grazing. Some studies suggest that grazing helps promote native
plant diversity on grasslands, but the impact of grazing on plants that
reside in pool basins is largely unknown. We investigated how one aspect
of cattle grazing, the deposition of waste, affects these plant species
by adding dung and urine to mesocosms lined with vernal pool soil. As a
result of dung input, orthophosphate, conductivity, and turbidity
increased in our mesocosms while dissolved oxygen decreased. Such
changes in water quality are consistent with a shift toward a eutrophic
state. Algal biomass and percent-cover also increased in dung-treated
mesocosms. When the mesocosms dried, vascular plant species richness and
percent-cover in dung-treated mesocosms were reduced by up to 54{\%} and
87{\%}, respectively. We attribute this to light attenuation by algal mats
that flourished in the nutrient-enriched water. We also found that dung
input caused significant, but weak, shifts in the composition of the
vascular plant community. We conclude that cattle grazing may be
detrimental to plant communities in vernal pools via increased nutrient
loading, which promotes algal growth. Any beneficial effects of grazing
may thus be limited to the surrounding grassland. Studies that examine

grasslands worldwide. However, management of these weeds is constrained
by the practical difficulty of detecting small-scale infestations across
large landscapes and by limits in understanding of landscape- scale
invasion dynamics, including mechanisms that enable patches to expand,
contract, or remain stable. While high-end hyperspectral remote sensing
systems can effectively map vegetation cover, these systems are
currently too costly and limited in availability for most land managers.
We demonstrate application of a more accessible and cost-effective
remote sensing approach, based on simple aerial imagery, for quantifying
weed cover dynamics over time. In California annual grasslands, the
target communities of interest include invasive weedy grasses (Aegilops
triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae) and desirable forage grass species
(primarily Avena spp. and Bromus spp.). Detecting invasion of annual
grasses into an annual-dominated community is particularly challenging,
but we were able to consistently characterize these two communities
based on their phenological differences in peak growth and senescence
using maximum likelihood supervised classification of imagery acquired
twice per year (in mid-and end-of season). This approach permitted us to
map weed-dominated cover at a 1-m scale (correctly detecting 93{\%} of
weed patches across the landscape) and to evaluate weed cover change
over time. We found that weed cover was more pervasive and persistent in
management units that had no significant grazing for several years than
in those that were grazed, whereas forage cover was more abundant and
stable in the grazed units. This application demonstrates the power of
this method for assessing fine-scale vegetation transitions across
heterogeneous landscapes. It thus provides means for small-scale early
detection of invasive species and for testing fundamental questions
about landscape dynamics.},

promotes vegetation restoration in degraded grasslands. By conducting a
4-year field restoration experiment with four N addition treatments (0,
5, 10, and 20 g Nm (2) year (1)) and two grazing treatments (grazed and
ungrazed), we investigated the effects of N enrichment and grazing on
the restoration of patches in which vegetation had been degraded. N
addition significantly accelerated the restoration of
vegetation-degraded grassland patches regarding both plant cover and
diversity. Moderate grazing also promoted the restoration of
degraded-vegetation patches in term of both plant diversity and species
similarity. Importantly, the positive effects of N addition on the
restoration of degraded patches may be augmented by grazing. This study
demonstrate that low levels of N enrichment (or increasing atmospheric N
deposition) positively impact vegetation restoration in degraded
grassland patches, particularly under moderate grazing practices. Our
findings provide new insights into the management of severely degraded
grasslands through the regulation of N inputs and grazing practices. (C)

abstract = {Herbivores, microbial mutualists, and soil nutrients can affect plant
survival, growth, and reproduction, demographic parameters that are
essential to plant restoration. In this study we ask: 1) whether native
plants that form early associations with mycorrhizal fungi are more
tolerant of mammalian grazers, and 2) how early plant associations with
mycorrhizal fungi influence mammalian grazing across gradients in soil
nutrients. In eight grassland sites in California (USA), we transplanted
seedlings of a native bunch grass, Stipa pulchra, that were or were not
pretreated with mycorrhizal fungi in exclosures designed to exclude
different guilds of vertebrate grazers. Pretreated plants had greater
establishment eight months after transplantation than untreated plants.
Mycorrhizal inoculation resulted in twofold greater biomass and fourfold
greater seed production when plants were protected from herbivores;
inoculation with mycorrhizae resulted in twofold greater biomass and
seed production when plants were accessible by all herbivores. Soil
phosphate and potassium concentrations influenced herbivory: vertebrate
grazing had less effect on transplant biomass and seed production at
sites with high phosphate - low potassium soils, but the effects of
grazing were more severe in low phosphate - high potassium soils.
Pretreatment with mycorrhizal fungi can result in greater survival,
growth, and reproduction of transplanted seedlings of native bunchgrass
S. pulchra. Our results also illustrate that soil conditions may
influence the extent to which the vertebrate herbivore community limits
restoration of S. pulchra: the effects of some small mammalian
herbivores (e.g., voles) was little affected by soil conditions, but
grazing by larger herbivores had a greater effect on S. pulchra
performance at sites with low phosphate - high potassium soils. In
helping identify the contribution of soil nutrients, herbivores, and
mycorrhizae to establishment and performance, our work has implications
for the restoration of a species that is likely a fundamental component
of pristine California grassland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson

the regional scale in western North America during the Miocene Climatic
Optimum (MCO) between similar to 17 and 14 Ma, but few studies have
looked at how the MCO affected basin-scale environments.
Paleoenvironmental reconstructions coupled with mammalian fossil
assemblages from the Crowder and Cajon Valley formations in the Mojave
Desert, California, contribute insights into local-scale (10s of
kilometers) responses to warming during the Hemingfordian and Barstovian
North American Land Mammal Ages. By integrating lithological
descriptions, phytolith analyses, carbon isotope composition of
preserved soil organic matter (delta C-13(SOM)), and elemental
geochemistry of paleosols, we provide reconstructions of depositional
environments, vegetation, and precipitation through the MCO. Phytolith
and delta C-13(SOM) evidence suggest that paleoenvironments were
predominately C-3 grasslands, with the earliest potential presence of
C-4 grasses in the region found within the Crowder Formation at similar
to 17 Ma. Based on elemental geochemistry of paleosols, mean annual
precipitation estimates are 807 (182) mm yr(-1) at 17 Ma in the Crowder
Formation and 740-800 (+/- 182) mm yr(-1) from 16 to 15 Ma in the Cajon
Valley Formation. Our multiproxy approach indicates that the Crowder and
Cajon Valley basins were stable, large-scale braided stream and
floodplain systems with intermittent paleosol development and
heterogeneity in vegetation and moisture conditions across spatial
scales. Overall, we find a signal of local paleoenvironmental stability
during the MCO; however, a significant drying trend in the Crowder
Formation does correspond with faunal turnover and reduction in the
number of taxa present. High species diversity within faunal
assemblages, especially among small mammals, and fewer shared species
between the Crowder and Cajon Valley assemblages than expected based on
bootstrap analysis indicate that peak mammal diversity was accommodated
at both local and regional scales during sustained tectonic activity and
the MCO in western North America.},

phenological development of fall, winter, and spring sown seeds. Plants

negatively affected total plant biomass. In a greenhouse experiment, we
compared growth in four light environments (100, 50, 27 and 9 {\%}

hectares of grasslands in the western United States. Applying picloram,
aminopyralid, and other growth regulator herbicides at late growth
stages reduces seed production of most exotic annual grasses. In this
study, we applied aminopyralid to T. caput-medusae to determine how
reducing seed production in the current growing season influenced cover
in the subsequent growing season. At eight annual grassland sites, we
applied aminopyralid at 55, 123, and 245 g ae ha(-1) in spring just
before T. caput-medusae heading. The two higher rates were also applied
pre-emergence (PRE) in fall to allow comparisons with this previously
tested timing. When applied in spring during the roughly 10-d period
between the flag leaf and inflorescence first becoming visible, just 55
g ae ha(-1) of aminopyralid greatly limited seed production and
subsequently reduced T. caput-medusae cover to nearly zero. Fall
aminopyralid applications were less effective against T. caput-medusae,
even at a rate of 245 g ae ha(-1). The growing season of application,
fall treatments, but not spring treatments, sometimes reduced cover of
desirable winter annual forage grasses. The growing season after
application, both spring and fall treatments tended to increase forage

vapor, energy, and CO2 between California serpentine grassland and the
atmosphere. Even though the system was built around an inexpensive,
one-dimensional sonic anemometer and a closed-path CO2 analyzer, energy
balance closure was accurate to +/-20{\%} at a net radiation of 500
W/m(2), and the spectra and cospectra indicated only modest information
loss from incompletely resolved high-frequency turbulence.
In the early and middle parts of the growing season, net radiation,
latent heat, and sensible heat all had similar diurnal dynamics, with
latent heat accounting for approximate to 60{\%} of the net radiation.
Late in the growing season, energy dissipation by latent heat dropped
dramatically, even though the vapor pressure gradient remained high.
The Omega factor, an index of the role of canopy conductance in
regulating transpiration (Jarvis and McNaughton 1986), decreased from
0.8 early in the growing season (indicating predominant control of
transpiration by net radiation) to 0.1 late in the growing season
(indicating a shift to control of transpiration by canopy conductance
and vapor pressure deficit). Canopy conductance was a linear function of
the product of net photosynthesis and relative humidity, divided by the
CO2 concentration, as predicted by Ball (1988). The slope of the
relationship, however, was greater early in the growing season than at
other times.
Whole-ecosystem carbon exchange rates were modest, with midday net
photosynthesis reaching maximum values of 6-8 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) in
early April. Diurnal variation in photosynthesis roughly paralleled
variation in photosynthetically active photon flux density (PFD), but
with the daily maximum increasing with canopy development early in the
growing season and decreasing with drought at the end of the growing
season. Photosynthesis did not clearly saturate at high levels of PFD.
Ecosystem dark respiration increased strongly (Q(10) = 4.6) with
increasing soil surface temperature.
The efficiency with which absorbed radiation was used in ecosystem
photosynthesis, integrated over entire days, was 0.0115 +/- 0.0015 mol
CO2/mol PFD (approximate to 20{\%} of the values measured for healthy,
single leaves under low light conditions) until late in the growing
season, when the efficiency fell sharply. Using simple assumptions to
extrapolate measurements from 11 d to the entire growing season, we
estimate ecosystem annual gross primary production to be 11.1 mol
CO2/m(2), yielding an annual net primary production of approximate to
133 g biomass/m(2). This is near the center of the range of published

filters that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are
predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are
functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key
functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for
reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil
nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on
restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub
vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly
invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously
challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities
composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group
abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity)

to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction
decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing
exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For
instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native
community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the
phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient

LocationCalifornia, USA.
MethodsWe used time series of gridded absorbed photosynthetically active
radiation (APAR) to quantify the short- and long-term responses of
diverse ecosystems to variation in precipitation across large
productivity and precipitation gradients. We investigated the
relationships between temporal sensitivity of APAR to interannual
variation in precipitation and mean annual precipitation (MAP),
ecosystem properties and disturbance.
ResultsAPAR increased with precipitation both interannually within
locations and across locations with MAP. The slope of the interannual
relationship, which reflects the sensitivity of APAR to short-term
fluctuations in precipitation, varied with climate, vegetation type and
structure, and time since disturbance. The interannual APAR sensitivity
decreased from c. 0.5 MJ m(-2)mm(-1) at a MAP of 300mm year(-1) to less
than 0.05 MJ m(-2)mm(-1) at 1000mm year(-1). The slope of the spatial
relationship, which reflects the long-term sensitivity of APAR to
climate, decreased from c. 2.5 MJ m(-2)mm(-1) at 300mm year(-1) MAP to
c. 0.6 MJ m(-2)mm(-1) at 1000mm year(-1). The initial physiological and
leaf area effects of a precipitation shift were amplified five-fold over
time by gradual changes in population density and species composition.
Main conclusionThe impact of a hydroclimatic shift on the primary
production, structure and function of California's terrestrial
ecosystems depends heavily on time-scale and how rapidly changes in
plant population density and community composition can occur.},

abstract = {Compost amendments to grasslands have been proposed as a strategy to
mitigate climate change through carbon (C) sequestration, yet little
research exists exploring the net mitigation potential or the long-term
impacts of this strategy. We used field data and the DAYCENT
biogeochemical model to investigate the climate change mitigation
potential of compost amendments to grasslands in California, USA. The
model was used to test ecosystem C and greenhouse gas responses to a
range of compost qualities (carbon to nitrogen {\{}[{\}}C:N] ratios of 11.1,
20, or 30) and application rates (single addition of 14 Mg C/ha or 10
annual additions of 1.4 Mg C.ha(-1)yr(-1)). The model was parameterized
using site-specific weather, vegetation, and edaphic characteristics and
was validated by comparing simulated soil C, nitrous oxide (N2O),
methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, and net primary
production (NPP) with three years of field data. All compost amendment
scenarios led to net greenhouse gas sinks that persisted for several
decades. Rates of climate change mitigation potential ranged from 130
+/- 3 g to 158 +/- 8 g CO2-eqm(-2)yr(-1) (where eq stands for
equivalents) when assessed over a 10-year time period and 63 +/- 2 g to
84 +/- 10 g CO2-eqm(-2)yr(-1) over a 30-year time period. Both C storage
and greenhouse gas emissions increased rapidly following amendments.
Compost amendments with lower C:N led to higher C sequestration rates
over time. However, these soils also experienced greater N2O fluxes.
Multiple smaller compost additions resulted in similar cumulative C
sequestration rates, albeit with a time lag, and lower cumulative N2O
emissions. These results identify a trade-off between maximizing C

abstract = {Biotic/abiotic interactions between soil mineral nutrients and annual
grassland vegetation are characterized for five soils in a marine
terrace chronosequence near Santa Cruz, California. A Mediterranean
climate, with wet winters and dry summers, controls the annual cycle of
plant growth and litter decomposition, resulting in net above-ground
productivities of 280-600 g m(-2) yr(-1). The biotic/abiotic (A/B)
interface separates seasonally reversible nutrient gradients, reflecting
biological cycling in the shallower soils, from downward chemical
weathering gradients in the deeper soils. The A/B interface is
pedologically defined by argillic clay horizons centered at soil depths
of about one meter which intensify with soil age. Below these horizons,
elevated solute Na/Ca, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios reflect plagioclase and
smectite weathering along pore water flow paths. Above the A/B
interface, lower cation ratios denote temporal variability due to
seasonal plant nutrient uptake and litter leaching. Potassium and Ca
exhibit no seasonal variability beneath the A/B interface, indicating
closed nutrient cycling within the root zone, whereas Mg variability
below the A/B interface denotes downward leakage resulting from higher
inputs of marine aerosols and lower plant nutrient requirements.
The fraction of a mineral nutrient annually cycled through the plants,
compared to that lost from pore water discharge, is defined their
respective fluxes F-j,F-plants = q(j,plants)/(q(j,plants) +
q(j,discharge)) with average values for K and Ca (F-K,F-plants = 0.99;
F-Ca,F-plants = 0.93) much higher than for Mg and Na (F-Mg,F-plants
0.64; F-Na,F-plants = 0.28). The discrimination against Rb and Sr by
plants is described by fractionation factors (K-Sr/Ca = 0.86; K-Rb/K =
0.83) which are used in Rayleigh fractionation-mixing calculations to
fit seasonal patterns in solute K and Ca cycling. K-Rb/K and K-24Mg/22Mg
values (derived from isotope data in the literature) fall within
fractionation envelopes bounded by inputs from rainfall and mineral
weathering. K-Sr/Ca and K-44Ca/40Ca fractionation factors fall outside
these envelopes indicating that Ca nutrient cycling is closed to these
external inputs. Small net positive K and Ca fluxes (6-14 mol m(-2)
yr(-1)), based on annual mass balances, indicate that the soils are
accumulating mineral nutrients, probably as a result of long-term
environmental disequilibrium. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

regional biodiversity due to high local endemism. Fire frequency has
been increasing in MTEs and while altered fire regimes have been shown
to threaten native shrub communities, their effect on vernal pools is
uncertain. Due to the number of at-risk species in this habitat,
experiments with potentially harmful effects are problematic. Therefore,
we initiated this study to take advantage of two anthropogenic but

2009 on a site burned in 2000 and 2003. We analyzed the data in an
exploratory framework and applied unadjusted and adjusted models using
different parameterizations of the exposure variables. The results did
not provide evidence that fire reduced the abundance of native vernal

positive but temporary effect of fire on native vernal pool species. Our
analysis demonstrates an exploratory analytical approach for use with

abstract = {1. Ecological filter models derived from community assembly theory can
inform restoration planning by highlighting management actions most
likely to affect community composition. Despite growing interest in
these models, many restoration studies solely manipulate a single
assembly filter - the biotic filter by altering interspecific
competition - while ignoring abiotic and dispersal filters that may also
influence restoration success.
2. To examine how manipulating all three assembly filters (biotic,
abiotic, dispersal) affected restoration in an annual-type grassland, we
seeded native forbs from the same functional group as a target invader
to increase biotic resistance to invasion (biotic filter), cut standing
biomass and either removed it or returned it to plots as litter to alter
light conditions (abiotic filter), and added native forbs at different
seeding rates to alter density of establishing native populations
(dispersal filter). We measured grassland restoration success by
recording native species and invader cover in plots.
3. The addition of native species with phenological and morphological
traits similar to the target invader reduced invasion and increased
native populations, but only in litter-free plots when high densities of
native seed were added.
4. Seeding two species with functional traits similar to the invader was
more effective for achieving restoration goals than seeding just one
functionally similar species. As such, trait differences among
restoration species, even species belonging to the same functional
group, may increase biotic resistance to invasion in restored
communities.
5. Litter removal altered native-invader interactions. When litter was
left on the plots, added natives did not reduce invader cover. However,
when litter was removed, added natives led to declines in invader cover.
6. Increasing native seeding rates led to larger native populations and
increased invasion resistance.
7. Synthesis and applications. In this study, simultaneously
manipulating biotic, abiotic and dispersal filters was necessary to
optimize grassland restoration outcomes. In particular, the biotic
filter only contributed to successful restoration outcomes under abiotic
and dispersal conditions that were created through management actions
specifically targeting these two additional filters. Restoration
planning based on filter models should incorporate actions that target
all three assembly filters, rather than solely focusing on the biotic
filter.},

relative importance of phenotypic and genotypic factors in controlling
nutrient resorption, we sampled several mediterranean trees and shrubs
growing in serpentine and nonserpentine soils in northern California.
Plants growing in serpentine soils had smaller, thicker leaves than
those growing in richer sites and had lower N and P concentrations and
pools on a unit-area basis. Pools of nutrients resorbed and nutrients
left in litter in rich-site leaves were larger than pools in poor-site
leaves, but N resorption efficiency (percent of total leaf N resorbed)
was higher in less fertile sites (65 vs. 46{\%}). Differences in
efficiency may be due to the ratio of soluble/nonsoluble proteins, which
is higher at low-N sites. Trends for phosphorus resorption efficiency
were not significant (47 vs. 46{\%} in poor and rich sites, respectively).
There were no significant differences among species adapted to poor vs.
rich soils, nor between needle vs. broad-leaved species. We conclude
that a high nutrient resorption efficiency is a phenotypic response to

evaluated the performance of the 2015 model by revisiting 150 boxes in

occupancy for each nest box. Barn owls occupied approximately one third
of the nest boxes we monitored each year. We used variance decomposition
to address cross scale correlations among three nested spatial scales
and to analyze the variation in nest box occupancy explained uniquely by
predictors at each spatial scale. The home range and nest box scales
were the most important spatial scales. At the home range scale, barn
owls selected nest boxes surrounded by more hectares of grassland,
riparian and mixed forest, and fewer hectares of oak scrub within 1 km
of the box. Owls were more likely to occupy nest boxes if they were
constructed of wood, facing north and positioned higher off the ground.
The model developed in 2015 performed well in 2016, correctly
classifying 81.3{\%} of the boxes, and the area under the receiver

presence of benomyl, P addition significantly increased shoot P

understand the relative importance of local and regional habitat
characteristics for grassland butterflies, we assessed butterfly
community diversity in four types of grassland habitats surrounded by
varying amounts of urban development near Boulder, Colorado ( U.S.A.).
We recorded butterfly species abundance and composition in 66 grassland
study plots on five sampling dates in 1999 and 2000. Grasslands were of
four types: native shortgrass, native mixed grass, native tallgrass, and
planted hayfields. Grasslands also varied in quality, determined by the
abundance of native versus exotic plant species. We observed highly
significant effects of grassland type on butterfly species richness and
composition. For example, tallgrass plots supported significantly higher
butterfly species richness than shortgrass plots ( p {\textless} 0.01). Habitat
quality also affected butterfly species richness and composition.
Low-quality plots generally supported fewer species than moderate- or
high-quality plots ( p {\textless} 0.05). Landscape context-the percentage of
urbanization in the surrounding landscape-did not significantly predict
butterfly species richness or composition. Our observations suggest that
for the grassland butterfly communities in our study, (1) grassland type

Treatments were ungrazed, lightly grazed (1,500 kg.ha(-1) residual dry

previous gear's rainfall. Grazing intensity did not affect total
herbaceous cover at springs. A year X grazing treatment interaction

Three years after grazing removal, total herbaceous cover on ungrazed

relatively stable. Plant community composition and stability by year and

stable plant communities persisted on sites regardless of grazing

interannual fluctuations, especially under increased grazing
intensities. This attribute renders cover a more useful gauge of

abstract = {Changes in the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities have
the potential to impact ecosystems via interactions with plants and
weathering minerals. Previous studies of forested long-term (1000s -
100,000s of years) chronosequences suggest that surface microbial
communities change with soil age. However, significant gaps remain in
our understanding of long-term soil microbial community dynamics,
especially for non-forested ecosystems and in subsurface soil horizons.
We investigated soil chemistry, aboveground plant productivity, and soil
microbial communities across a grassland chronosequence (65,000-226,000
yrs old) located near Santa Cruz, CA. Aboveground net primary
productivity (ANPP) initially increased to a maximum and then decreased
for the older soils. We used polar lipid fatty acids (PLFA) to
investigate microbial communities including both surface ({\textless}0.1 m) and
subsurface ({\textgreater}= 0.2 m) soil horizons. PLFAs characteristic of
Gram-positive bacteria and actinobacteria increased as a fraction of the
microbial community with depth while the fungal fraction decreased
relative to the surface. Differences among microbial communities from
each chronosequence soil were found primarily in the subsurface where
older subsurface soils had smaller microbial community biomass, a higher
proportion of fungi, and a different community structure than the
younger subsurface soil. Subsurface microbial community shifts in
biomass and community structure correlated with, and were likely driven
by, decreasing soil P availability and Ca concentrations, respectively.
Trends in soil chemistry as a function of soil age led to the separation
of the biological ({\textless}= 1 m depth) and geochemical ({\textgreater}1 m) cycles in the
old, slowly eroding landscape we investigated, indicating that this
separation, commonly observed in tropical and subtropical ecosystems,
can also occur in temperate climates. This study is the first to
investigate subsurface microbial communities in a long-term
chronosequence. Our results highlight connections between soil chemistry
and both the aboveground and belowground parts of an ecosystem. (C) 2009

annual grassland community composition, above-ground net primary
production (ANPP), and density?
Location: California annual grassland.
Methods: We manipulated litter and light levels independently and in
concert. Litter removal and litter addition treatments tested both the
physical and chemical impacts of litter's presence. We additionally
simulated the effect of litter physical shading by using shade cloth,
and added powdered litter to test for the chemical impacts of
decomposing litter.
Results: Increased whole litter and shading decreased grass germination
and establishment, but not that of forbs or legumes. Species shifts
occurred within all groups across treatments, including a transition
from small-seeded to large-seeded grass and legume species with
increased shading. ANPP was highest in control plots ( 473 +/- 59
g/m(2)), and species richness was highest in litter removal plots. While
the physical effects of litter via shading were significant, the
chemical effects of adding powdered litter were negligible.
Conclusions: This work suggests that over one growing season, the
physical impacts of litter are more important than chemical impacts in
shaping community structure and ANPP in annual grasslands. Changes in
light availability with altered litter inputs drive shifts in species
and functional group composition. Litter feedbacks to ANPP and species
composition of local patches may help maintain diversity and stabilize
ANPP in this grassland.},

Removal of non-native ungulates is an increasingly common and crucial
first step in conserving and restoring native forests. However, removal
is often controversial and there is currently little information on
plant community responses to this management action. Here, we examine
the response of native and non-native understory vegetation in paired
sites inside and outside of exclosures across a 6.5-18.5 year
chronosequence of feral pig (Sus scrofa) removal from canopy-intact
Hawaiian tropical montane wet forest. Stem density and cover of native
plants, species richness of ground-rooted native woody plants, and
abundance of native plants of conservation interest were all
significantly higher where feral pigs had been removed. Similarly, the
area of exposed soil was substantially lower and cover of litter and
bryophytes was greater with feral pig removal. Spatial patterns of
recruitment were also strongly affected. Whereas epiphytic establishment
was similar between treatments, the density of ground-rooted woody
plants was four times higher with feral pig removal. Abundance of
invasive non-native plants also increased at sites where they had
established prior to feral pig removal. We found no patterns in any of
the measured variables with time, suggesting that commonly occurring
species recover within 6.5 years of feral pig removal. Recovery of
species of conservation interest, however, was highly site specific and
limited to areas that possessed remnant populations at the time of
removal, indicating that some species take much longer ({\textgreater} 18.5 years) to
recover. Feral pig removal is the first and most crucial step for
conservation of native forests in this area, but subsequent management
should also include control of non-native invasive plants and
outplanting native species of conservation interest that fail to recruit
naturally.},

Studies of invasibility are common in successionally stable grasslands,
but rare in recently disturbed or seral forests. We used 16 yr of
species richness and abundance data from 1 m(2) plots in a clearcut and
burned forest in the Cascade Range of western Oregon to address the
following questions: 1) is invasion success correlated with properties
of the native community? Are correlations stronger among pools of
functionally similar taxa (i.e. exotic and native annuals)? Do these
relationships change over successional time? 2) Does exotic abundance
increase with removal of potentially dominant native species? 3) Do the
population dynamics of exotic and native species differ, suggesting that
exotics are more successful colonists? Exotics were primarily annual and
biennial species. Regardless of the measure of success (richness, cover,
biomass, or density) or successional stage, most correlations between
exotics and natives were non-significant. Exotic and native annuals
showed positive correlations during mid-succession, but these were
attributed to shared associations with bare ground rather than to direct
biotic interactions. At peak abundance, neither cover nor density of
exotics differed between controls and plots from which native,
mid-successional dominants were removed. Tests comparing nine measures
of population performance (representing the pace, magnitude, and
duration of population growth) revealed no significant differences
between native and exotic species. In this early successional system,
local richness and abundance of exotics are not explained by properties
of the native community, by the presence of dominant native species, or
by superior colonizing ability among exotics species. Instead natives

suggesting similar sets of life-history traits leading to similar
successional roles.},

Abundant rainfall late in the wet season in WY 2004, a year with average

models were used as input variables for an existing rangeland forage
production model (linear regression) for California's annual rangelands
and projected on 244 12 km x 12 km grid cells for eight Bay Area
counties. Climate model projections suggest that forage production in
Bay Area rangelands may be enhanced by future conditions in most years,
at least in terms of peak standing crop. However, the timing of
production is as important as its peak, and altered precipitation
patterns could mean delayed germination, resulting in shorter growing
seasons and longer periods of inadequate forage quality. An increase in
the frequency of extremely dry years also increases the uncertainty of
forage availability. These shifts in forage production will affect the
economic viability and conservation strategies for rangelands in the San
Francisco Bay Area.},

abstract = {Understanding how environmental variables affect the processes that
regulate the carbon flux over grassland is critical for large-scale
modeling research, since grasslands comprise almost one-third of the
earth's natural vegetation. To address this issue, fluxes of CO2 (F-c,
flux toward the surface is negative) were measured over a Mediterranean,
annual grassland in California, USA for 2 years with the eddy covariance
method.
To interpret the biotic and abiotic factors that modulate F-c over the
course of a year we decomposed net ecosystem CO2 exchange into its
constituent components, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary
production (GPP). Daytime R-eco was extrapolated from the relationship
between temperature and nighttime F-c under high turbulent conditions.
Then, GPP was estimated by subtracting daytime values of F-c from
daytime estimates of R-eco.
Results show that most of carbon exchange, both photosynthesis and
respiration, was limited to the wet season (typically from October to
mid-May). Seasonal variations in GPP followed closely to changes in leaf
area index, which in turn was governed by soil moisture, available
sunlight and the timing of the last frost. In general, R-eco was an
exponential function of soil temperature, but with season-dependent
values of Q(10). The temperature-dependent respiration model failed
immediately after rain events, when large pulses of R-eco were observed.
Respiration pulses were especially notable during the dry season when
the grass was dead and were the consequence of quickly stimulated
microbial activity.
Integrated values of GPP, R-eco, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were
867, 735, and -132 g C m(-2), respectively, for the 2000-2001 season,
and 729, 758, and 29 g C m(-2) for the 2001-2002 season. Thus, the
grassland was a moderate carbon sink during the first season and a weak
carbon source during the second season. In contrast to a well-accepted
view that annual production of grass is linearly correlated to
precipitation, the large difference in GPP between the two seasons were
not caused by the annual precipitation. Instead, a shorter growing
season, due to late start of the rainy season, was mainly responsible
for the lower GPP in the second season. Furthermore, relatively higher
R-eco during the non-growing season occurred after a late spring rain.
Thus, for this Mediterranean grassland, the timing of rain events had
more impact than the total amount of precipitation on ecosystem GPP and
NEE. This is because its growing season is in the cool and wet season
when carbon uptake and respiration are usually limited by low
temperature and sometimes frost, not by soil moisture. (C) 2003 Elsevier

decades, supporting a major paradigm shift concerning the role of
grazing in addressing critical natural resource management challenges
across the globe. A next step for expanding adoption is to understand
how conservation benefits derived from this practice may change
depending on how the components of a targeted grazing strategy change.
Using two studies on California annual rangeland, one with heifers and
one with ewes, we evaluated how two stocking attributes that underpin a
targeted grazing plan, animal density and grazing duration, influence
the ability of livestock to reduce the abundance of the invasive annual
grass medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae IL] Nevski) and increase
the abundance of native plants. Across studies, conservation benefits
tended to be higher (lower invasive plant abundance and greater native
plant abundance) under higher stocking density and shorter stocking
duration, but we also found evidence that stocking density could be
relaxed in some situations, allowing some conservation benefits to be
achieved by grazing fewer animals over a longer duration. For California
annual rangelands where most vegetation growth occurs over a period of a
few short weeks, the potential to achieve similar conservation benefits
by extending grazing duration and using fewer animals represents a major
opportunity to apply targeted grazing over larger areas in one season
with a set number of grazing animals. These initial findings provide
justification for more extensive research in how changes in targeted
grazing strategies may alter conservation benefits from grazing. Such
insight is essential for understanding the range of cost-benefit
trade-offs that may occur with this practice. (C) 2017 The Society for

were combined in subsequent analyses. Overall, all introduced species
grew significantly faster than native species. Native species showed
greater variation in response to soil communities than both groups of
introduced species, and native species' response varied with soil
community. Variation among native species' response to soil nutrients

maintaining diversity across landscapes in uninvaded environments.
Introduced species appear less responsive to landscape variability in

Plantago. Given the limited changes in the compounds related to

existed prior to European settlement has been developed for human uses.
Over the past two to three decades, public agencies and land
conservation organizations have worked to acquire some of the remaining
lands for preservation. Many of these lands are degraded by past
intensive livestock grazing, farming, and frequent fires, and the native
flora has been replaced by weedy, exotic annual grasses and forbs,
mostly of Mediterranean origin. Restoration of native flora is
challenging and there are few successful examples to provide guidance on
effective methods. Cost is also an important and prohibitive factor.
Competition from weeds is one of the most difficult impediments to
establishing native vegetation, which often persists in the seedbank. We
compared annual applications of the nonselective herbicide glyphosate
over multiple years, followed by a final year with the grass-specific
fluazifop, as a simple, low cost method of reducing the exotic seedbank
sufficiently to allow native vegetation to establish. This approach was
combined with seeding native forbs, herbaceous perennials, and shrubs in
one half of each treatment plot. Herbicide treatments were made in the
spring each year from 2006 to 2010, and were combined with weed trimming
in 2010 and 2011 to remove exotic forb inflorescences, and raking to
remove litter. In 2010, native plant cover in herbicide-treated plots
was about 50{\%}, consisting of 43 species, compared to {\textless}5{\%} cover in the

spot spraying or hand inflorescence trimming, and is more cost-effective
than hand weed control and raking for restoration.},

Mediterranean Europe have nearly displaced native perennial grasses

examines the impact of this invasion on carbon cycling and storage at
two sites in northern coastal California. The results suggest that
annual grass invasion has caused an average drop in soil carbon storage

mechanisms may also contribute to soil carbon losses. We attribute the
reduction in soil carbon storage to low rates of net primary production
in non-native annuals relative to perennial grasses, a shift in rooting
depth and water use to primarily shallow sources, and soil respiratory
losses in non-native grass soils that exceed production rates. These
results indicate that even seemingly subtle land cover changes can

highly invasive on rangelands of the western United States. It
originates from the Mediterranean basin and was introduced accidentally
into North America in the late 1800s. To increase our knowledge of the
soil factors that may contribute to its invasiveness, we conducted a
reciprocal transplant experiment. Seed sources used were from an
invasive population in northeastern California, USA and from a native
population in southern France. Four soils were used: two from
northeastern California, invaded (USI) and non-invaded (USN) by T.
caput-medusae; two from southern France, with T. caput-medusae occupied
(FR+) and a similar soil presently unoccupied (FR-) by T. caput-medusae.
Treatments were control and autoclaved. Seeds were sown in containers
(six replicates) for each soil and treatment combination of the
reciprocal planting matrix and allowed to grow for 60 days. Following
harvest, above-ground and below-ground tissue was dried and weight
recorded separately. Above-ground tissue was analyzed for nutrient
concentrations and various soil nutrient pools were quantified.
Above-ground mass of T. caput-medusae was greatest in the USN soil and
least in the FR- soil. Growth was affected by significant seed source x
soil and treatment x soil interactions. French seed produced larger
plants than did US seed when grown in the USN soil. For the USI soil,
plant growth was significantly greater in the autoclaved soil than
control. Availability of soil Fe, Mn, and ortho-P were significant
predictors of plant growth as shown by stepwise regression. Moreover,
the positive effect on growth of T. caput-medusae, due to autoclaving of
USI soil, may be partially a consequence of elevated nutrient
availability. Our data also suggests that US seed may have evolved a
greater ability to uptake Mn from soil than French seed. Elevated soil
nutrient availability in our western United States study area is a
potential factor explaining the invasiveness of T. caput-medusae.},

use nitrogen (N) more completely and efficiently, with implications for
how species conservation efforts might influence N cycling and retention

manipulated species richness and minimized environmental heterogeneity,
two design aspects that may reduce applicability to real ecosystems.
Here we present results from an experiment directly comparing how
realistic and randomized plant species losses affect plant N use across
a gradient of soil depth in a native-dominated serpentine grassland in
California. We found that the strength of the species richness effect on
plant N use did not increase with soil depth in either the realistic or
randomized species loss scenarios, indicating that the increased
vertical heterogeneity conferred by deeper soils did not lead to greater
complementarity among species in this ecosystem. Realistic species
losses significantly reduced plant N uptake and altered N-use
efficiency, while randomized species losses had no effect on plant N
use. Increasing soil depth positively affected plant N uptake in both
loss order scenarios but had a weaker effect on plant N use than did
realistic species losses. Our results illustrate that realistic species
losses can have functional consequences that differ distinctly from
randomized losses, and that species diversity effects can be independent
of and outweigh those of environmental heterogeneity on ecosystem
functioning. Our findings also support the value of conservation efforts
aimed at maintaining biodiversity to help buffer ecosystems against

landslides within a 9.5 km(2) area near Santa Barbara, California. They
were studied to analyze the sediment delivery to valley floors from
landslides in coastal sage scrub and converted grasslands. The
conversion of coastal sage to grasslands, primarily to provide pasturage
for cattle, is common in the region, and the landscape's response may
affect water quality, reservoir infilling, and debris flow hazards. We
explore the relationship between lateral-root reinforcement and
landslide volume by developing a slope-stability analysis that
incorporates root cohesion along the sides of the failure. The stability
analysis correctly predicts an inverse relationship between landslide
volume and hillslope angle in the sage. The volumes of failures in the
grasslands do not vary systematically with slope and are generally
smaller than those in the sage. From aerial -photograph analysis and
field mapping, we find that there are 22.9 failures per square kilometer
in the grasslands compared to 13.2 failures per square kilometer in the
sage. Despite the lower failure density in the coastal sage, greater
failure volumes and longer transport distances delivered more sediment
to valley floors, with a specific volumetric flux of 2.8 X 10(-2)
m(3).m(-1) for this El Nino compared to 1.7 X 10(-2) m(3).m(-1) in the
grasslands. We conclude that the conversion from vegetation with
stronger and deeper roots (coastal sage) to vegetation with weaker and
shallower roots (grass) has caused a pulse of increased landsliding in
the grasslands because the soils are currently too thick for the
prevailing root reinforcement. We suggest that, over time, soils in the
grassland hollows will become thinner as the evacuation by landslides is
repeated until the landsliding rate declines to balance the soil
supplied from local colluvium production and diffusive processes

results were generally congruent, and the only indications of lower
faunal diversity on mid-season grazed wetlands were trends of lower
abundance across morphospecies and lower diversity for canopy fauna
across assemblage metrics. Treatment x Season interactions almost
absent. Thus impacts on vegetation structure only minimally cascaded
into the arthropod assemblage and were not greatly intensified during
the annual growing season. Differences between years, which were likely
a response to divergent snowfall patterns, were more important than
differences between early and mid-season. Reliance on either vegetation

using both flora and fauna served to provide a more integrative view of

accumulation and leaching of phosphorus (P) and heavy metals in
agricultural sand soils, the horizontal and vertical variations of soil
P and metals in a 408-m(2) plot within a grove under grapefruit (Citrus

horizontal variation of labile soil P and metal concentrations was
observed. Across the row, the highest values of pH, EC, water-soluble P,
and all metals occurred in the soils under the canopies, and the lowest
values occurred in the soils near the water furrow or the midway of the
inter-row. Along the grapefruit row, the highest values of many measured
variables occurred along the northern side of the citrus tree and close
to the emitter. The downward movement of P, Cu, and Zn in the soils was
more significant in the soils in open areas (near the water furrow and
midway of inter-neighboring trees) than those under the canopies. The
differences in labile P and metal spatial distributions in the soils
were related to the location of emitter fertigation and differences in
rainfall-induced leaching in the field. The results suggest that
applying fertilizers to sites tinder the canopy rather than the spaces
between the trees can minimize leaching losses of nutrients.},

In California annual grasslands, patches of Lilium multiflorum Lam. and

limit the productivity and associated resource use of these grasslands.
The effect that differences in spatial aggregation, gap distribution and
species mixing on 20-cm-diameter plots has on overall forage production
by these two grasses was tested. There were three levels of aggregation:
whole plots planted; half planted/half empty; two opposing quarters
planted/two empty. Each species was planted in each distribution, and
they were combined as mixed, half L. multiflorum/half B. hordeaceus and
two quarters L. multiflorum/two quarters B. hordeaceus (nine
treatments). Plant aggregation had no significant effect on above-ground
production of whole plots, but individual tillers near gaps were
significantly larger than others. Plasticity in the growth of individual
annual grasses effectively buffered against variation in average
productivity resulting from variations in plant distribution. There were
significant (P {\textless} 0.001) differences in forage production as a result of
the species the plots contained. Plots containing only L. multiflorum
produced 4053 kg of dry matter (DM) ha(-1), B. hordeaceus plots produced
2448 kg of DM ha(-1), and plots containing both species produced 4712 kg
of DM ha-1. At small scales, spatial distribution was less important

abstract = {Question: How does responsiveness to water and Nitrogen (N) availability
vary across the compositional and functional diversity that exists in a
mesic California annual grassland plant community?
Location: Northern California annual grassland.
Methods: A mesocosm system was used to simulate average annual
precipitation totals and dry and wet year extremes observed in northern
California mesic grasslands. The effects of precipitation and N
availability on biomass and fecundity were measured on three different
vegetation types, a mixed grass forb community, and a forb and a grass
monoculture. The treatment effects on plant community composition were
examined in the mixed species community.
Results: While growth and seed production of the three vegetation types
was inherently different, their responses to variation in precipitation
and N were statistically similar. Plant density, shoot biomass, and seed
production tended to increase with greater water availability in all
vegetation types, with the exception of a consistent growth reduction in
high precipitation (1245 mm) plots in the first year of the study. Shoot
biomass responded positively to N addition, an effect that increased
with greater water availability. Nitrogen addition had little effect on
plant density or seed production. In the mixed grass-forb community,
biomass responsiveness to water and N treatments were consistently
driven by the shoot growth of A vena barbata, the dominant grass
species.
Conclusions: Vegetation responses to changes in precipitation and N
availability were consistent across a range of composition and
structural diversity in this study. Plant growth and seed production
were sensitive to both increased and decreased precipitation totals, and
the magnitude of these responses to N availability varied depending on
soil moisture conditions. Our results suggest the impacts of changing
precipitation regimes and N deposition on annual productivity of
California grasslands may be predictable under different climate
scenarios across a range of plant communities.},

abstract = {Large grazing animals can have profound impacts on plant communities and
soil properties; however, these impacts are not always uniform across or
within regions. The distribution of features such as forage quality,
water, or shade within a pasture can change the behavior of grazers and
thus, the impact of their grazing. Where managed livestock grazing has
been proposed as a conservation tool to enhance or maintain desirable
plant communities, understanding how spatial variation between tree and
intertree habitats within a savanna landscape affects the response of
vegetation and soil properties to grazing will be critical for designing
management plans for different sites. In this study, we used a
previously established, long-term livestock grazing experiment in
California oak {\{}[{\}}Quercus L.] savannas to investigate how the removal of
grazing affected plant communities and soil characteristics underneath
and outside of isolated tree canopies. In the oak understory, plant
community composition shifted in response to livestock removal, largely
due to a 68-400{\%} increase in the relative cover of native species.
Overall plant community composition in open grassland neighboring trees
changed little in response to livestock grazing removal, yet we did see
a decrease in species richness and diversity surrounding deciduous oaks
as the dominance of the exotic annual Bromus diandrus Roth increased.
The depth of plant litter increased 1 2 cm in both habitat types when
livestock grazing was absent, along with minor changes in soil carbon,
nitrogen, and bulk density. These results highlight how different
habitat patches within savanna landscape can have varying responses to
grazing removal and illustrate how challenging it will be to use grazing
as a management tool to enhance the diversity of native species. In the
oak understory, native species that are tolerant of herbivory may be
absent or unable to coexist with non-native annual grasses. The
abundance of understory habitat at a particular site may therefore be an
important variable predicting the outcome of livestock grazing. (C) 2017

at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (JRGCE), a long-term
multi-factor global change experiment in a California annual grassland.
The microbial community fingerprint and specific biomarkers varied
substantially from year to year, in both control and experimental
treatment plots. Possible drivers of the variability included plant
growth, soil moisture, and ambient temperature. Surprisingly, background
variation in the microbial community was of a larger magnitude than even
very significant treatment effects, and this variation appeared to
constrain responses to treatment. Microbial communities were mostly not
responsive or not consistently responsive to the experimental
treatments. Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomarker abundance (16
similar to:similar to 1 ?5c) and the fungal to bacterial ratio were
lower under nitrogen addition in most years. Bacterial lipid biomarker
abundances (15 similar to:similar to 0 iso and 16 similar to:similar to
1 ?7c) were higher under nitrogen addition in 2002, the year of largest
microbial biomass, suggesting that bacteria could respond more to
nitrogen addition in years of better growth conditions. Nitrogen
addition and warming led to an interactive effect on the Gram-positive
bacterial biomarker and the fungal to bacterial ratio. These patterns
indicate that in California grassland ecosystems, microbial communities
may not respond substantially to future changes in climate and that
nitrogen deposition may be a determinant of the soil response to global

composition may be important determinants of ecosystem response to
global change.},

important mechanism contributing to vegetation patchiness in fire-prone

N cycling by comparing N-15 natural abundance values from recently
burned and nearby unburned P. muricata forest communities. At the burned
site, N-15 natural abundance in recolonising species was similar to that
in bulk soil organic matter. By contrast, there was a marked N-15
depletion in the same species relative to the total soil N pool at the
unburned site. These results suggest that plant uptake of nitrate (which
tends to be strongly depleted in N-15 because of fractionation during
nitrification) is low in recently burned forest communities but could be
an important component of ecosystem N cycling in mature conifer stands.},

tested the viability of goatgrass seeds in both burned and unburned

was still strong 2 yr after the burn (burned, 6{\%}; unburned, 27{\%}) and

abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) transformations have been shown to be influenced by
plant community composition. Identifying species traits that control
nitrogen dynamics is more straightforward when species dramatically
differ in N input via litter (e.g., N-fixing invaders in a non-fixing
community) or in litter carbon: N or lignin: N ratios. Cases where
invaders and residents are more similar for such traits are more
challenging to evaluate. In these settings, a species' relative
abundance and its contribution to overall ecosystem productivity are
likely to contribute significantly to the development of effects on N
availability and cycling.
We compared soil N dynamics in experimental grassland communities
dominated by native perennial grasses (NP), exotic annual grasses (EA),
and exotic perennial grasses (EP), as well as mixtures of the native
perennial grasses with each exotic grass group (NP + EA and NP + EP).
These groups differ from each other in subtle ways in traits likely to
influence soil N cycling including annual productivity, allocation to
roots versus shoots, litter production, litter chemistry, and degree of
summertime activity. We found that ecosystem N dynamics were
significantly different between the various species groups with the
greatest differences occurring between EA plots and other community
types: soils in EA plots had significantly lower rates of net N
mineralization, net nitrification, and microbial biomass-N compared to
either NP or NP + EA plots, and lower extractable nitrate in the spring
compared to either NP or EP plots. The higher the proportion of
productivity in a plot that derived from exotic species, particularly
exotic annual species, the lower were the measured rates of net N
mineralization. Stepwise regression analysis showed that vegetation
productivity was the best predictor of N cycling metrics: the higher the
productivity, the higher the rates of net mineralization and
nitrification, and microbial biomass-N.
We conclude that species' abundance and productivity were strong
controlling factors in the development of differences in ecosystem N
dynamics between our experimental treatments. Inclusion of relative
proportion of productivity contributed by community members in models of
the development of species effects will likely aid in predicting when

fertilization on belowground C dynamics in a California annual grassland
soil (Haploxeralf) during a two-year greenhouse study. The fate of
(13)C-labeled belowground C (roots and organic matter) was followed
under planted (Avena barbata) and unplanted conditions, and with and
without supplemental N (20 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) over two periods of
plant growth, each followed by a dry, fallow period of 120 d. Turnover
of belowground (13)C SOM was followed using (13)C-phospholipid fatty
acid (PLFA) biomarkers. Living roots increased the turnover and loss of
belowground (13)C compared with unplanted soils. Planted soils had 20{\%}
less belowground (13)C present than in unplanted soils after 2 cycles of
planting and fallow. After 2 treatment cycles, unlabeled soil C was
4.8{\%} higher in planted soils than unplanted. The addition of N to soils
decreased the turnover of enriched belowground (13)C during the first

of N was observed thereafter. Our findings suggest that A. barbata may
increase soil C levels over time because root and exudate C inputs are
significant, but that increase will be moderated by an overall faster C
mineralization rate of belowground C. N addition may slow soil C losses;
however, the effect was minor and transient in this system. The labeled
root-derived (13)C was initially recovered in gram negative (highest
enrichment), gram positive, and fungal biomarkers. With successive
growing seasons, the labeled C in the gram negative and fungal markers
declined, while gram positive markers continued to accumulate labeled
belowground C. The rhizosphere of A. barbata shifted the microbial
community composition, resulting in greater abundances of gram negative
markers and lower abundances of gram positive, actinobacteria and
cyclopropyl PLFA markers compared to unplanted soil. However, the
longer-term utilization of labeled belowground C by gram positive
bacteria was enhanced in the rhizosphere microbial community compared
with unplanted soils. We suggest that the activities of gram positive

using the eddy covariance technique. Annual net carbon exchange (NEE)
ranged from -155 to -56 gC m(-2) year(-1) and from -88 to 141 gC m(-2)
year(-1) at the savanna and nearby grassland, respectively. Inter-annual
variability in NEE was significantly related to length of growing season
for the savanna, grassland, and tree canopy. We partitioned the NEE into
two separate terms-primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (ecosystem
respiration, R-eco)-and found that the GPP and R-eco of the savanna and
grassland depended primarily on the amount of seasonal precipitation
that occurred while grass and tree canopies were simultaneously active
rather than depending on annual precipitation. We also found that NEE
was greatly constrained by both R-eco and GPP and R-eco was
significantly constrained by GPP. R-eco increased by 79 gC m(-2)
year(-1) with each 100 gC m(-2) year(-1) increase in GPP. In addition,
measuring CO2 exchange separately in the overstory and understory of the
savanna over multiple years enabled us to partition Reco into
heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration terms in a new and direct way.
The sensitivity of R-eco to GPP (dR(eco)/dGPP) and the baseline of
respiration terms both provide useful tools for understanding the

abstract = {Cattle grazing and invasion by non-native plant species are
globally-ubiquitous changes occurring to plant communities that are
likely to reverberate through whole food webs. We used a manipulative
field experiment to quantify how arthropod community structure differed
in native and non-native California grassland communities in the
presence and absence of grazing. The arthropod community was strongly
affected by cattle grazing: the biovolume of herbivorous arthropods was
79{\%} higher in grazed than ungrazed plots, whereas the biovolume of
predatory arthropods was 13{\%} higher in ungrazed plots. In plots where
non-native grasses were grazed, arthropod biovolume increased, possibly
in response to increased plant productivity or increased nutritional
quality of rapidly-growing annual plants. Grazing may thus affect plant
biomass both through the direct removal of biomass, and through
arthropod-mediated impacts. We also expected the arthropod community to
differ between native and non-native plant communities; surprisingly,
arthropod richness and diversity did not vary consistently between these
grass community types, although arthropod abundance was slightly higher
in plots with native and ungrazed grasses. These results suggest that
whereas cattle grazing affects the arthropod community via direct and
indirect pathways, arthropod community changes commonly associated with
non-native plant invasions may not be due to the identity or dominance
of the invasive species in those systems, but to accompanying changes in
plant traits or functional group composition, not seen in this
experiment because of the similarity of the plant communities.},

higher concentrations of linoleic acid, while palo verde reached higher
levels of alpha-linolenic acid, followed by palo fierro and alfalfa hay.
Forages species with higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty

belowground net primary production (BNPP) from long-term experiments is
rather scarce. We aimed to understand how long-term changes in water and
nitrogen availability affect production and vertical allocation of roots
in semi-arid grasslands and its consequence on carbon (C) and nitrogen
(N) cycles.
Methods We investigated changes of BNPP and its vertical allocation
along the soil profile to 40 cm in depth in response to simultaneous
increases in water and N availability over 11 years in an old-field
grassland in northern China.
Results Water addition increased BNPP in all soil layers (0-10 cm, 10-20
cm, and 20-40 cm), and enhanced the percentage BNPP in the upper soils
but decreased that in 10-20 cm soil layer. Nitrogen addition decreased
BNPP in 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers as well as total BNPP in 0-40
cm, and increased the percentage BNPP in the upper soil layer but
decreased that in 10-20 cm soil layer. Water addition increased soil
total C and N concentrations in 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers, while
N addition only marginally decreased soil C:N ratio in 0-10 cm and 20-40
cm soil layers. Both soil total N concentration and soil C: N ratio were
closely related to BNPP.
Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of environmental
factors, especially water availability, in determining BNPP, and in turn
controlling soil nutrient accumulation in semi-arid grasslands, although
the specific mechanisms remain unclear. The projected increase in
precipitation in those semi-arid grasslands would enhance soil C and N
sequestration. The increased allocation of BNPP in upper soils with
long-term precipitation increment and N deposition may accelerate
thecycles of C and N in these ecosystems, and thus increase the risk of
soil C and N loss.},

in nine locations along an anthropogenic nitrogen deposition gradient in
coastal sage scrub (CSS) vegetation in southern California. The primary
pollutants were nitrogen oxides derived from vehicular emissions.
Extractable soil N on the gradient ranged from 5 to 87 mu g/g during the
summer months. For comparative purpose, we also assessed AM communities
in nitrogen-fertilized (60 kg N.ha(-1). yr(-1)) and unfertilized plots.
Nitrogen enrichment induced a shift in AM community composition. In
particular, an increasing input of nitrogen was associated with the
displacement of the larger-spored species of Scutellospora and Gigaspora
(due to a failure to sporulate) with a concomitant proliferation of
small-spored Glomus species (e.g., Glomus aggregatum, Glomus
leptotichum). A subsequent reduction in species richness and diversity
las measured by Shannon-Wiener index) accompanied eutrophication.
Nitrogen enrichment also significantly reduced spore abundance, modified
the timing of AM spore production in the most eutrophied site, and
reduced hyphal and vesicular root infection. The fertilization
experiment yielded similar patterns to those found along the gradient,
and hence nitrogen input most likely explains the relationship between
anthropogenic pollution and shifts in the AM communities. Such changes
also indicated that AM species were sensitive indicators of nitrogen
enrichment. The CSS is currently undergoing a conversion to
Mediterranean annual grasslands, especially in the more urban polluted
areas, and the shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal community may facilitate
grass dominance in this system.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Seasonal and inter-annual variability in ecosystem carbon dioxide
(CO2) exchange is attributed to numerous climate drivers. However,
climate effects on metabolism often override ecological functions. This
study seeks insight into which biological and ecological processes
influence temporal patterns of ecosystem productivity in natural
ecosystems.
2. The specific objectives of this study are to (i) identify seasonal
and inter-annual patterns of ecosystem-level photosynthesis in relation
to climatic conditions, (ii) examine and compare seasonal and
inter-annual variations in leaf traits for annual grasses and oak trees
across multiple years, and (iii) explore interactions among leaf traits
and ecosystem-level photosynthesis across multiple seasons and years.
3. We conducted this study in a woody savanna and open grassland in
California, USA. Ecosystem-level photosynthetic rates of annual grasses
(A(grass)) and oak tree canopy (A(canopy)) were deduced from eddy
covariance measurements over a 7-year period (2001 and 2007). In
conjunction, we sampled grass and oak leaves at weekly to monthly
intervals and constructed a multi-year time series of leaf nitrogen
concentration (N), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf carbon
concentration (C), and leaf carbon stable isotope discrimination
(Delta).
4. Given the same grass community age or tree canopy age, inter-annual
variations of the photosynthetic rates were up to 1-2 gC m-2 day-1 for
annual grasses and oak trees while the two types of vegetation were
exposed to different, wide ranges of inter-annual climate fluctuations:
up to 5 degrees C in daily mean soil temperature, 15{\%} in soil moisture,
and 10 mol m-2 day-1 in photosynthetically active radiation.
5. While both grass and oak leaf traits varied seasonally and
inter-annually, they experienced temporal patterns and seasonal peaks
that were distinct from one another. Multi-year means of grass leaf N,
C, Delta, and LMA were 2 center dot 3{\%}, 40 center dot 8{\%}, 22 center
dot 6 parts per thousand and 71 center dot 3 g m-2, respectively;
multi-year means of oak leaf N, C, Delta, and LMA were 1 center dot 9{\%},
45 center dot 1{\%}, 20 center dot 5 parts per thousand and 132 g m-2,
respectively.
6. Based on the analysis of variance, seasonal and inter-annual terms
were associated with A(grass) or A(canopy) up to 90{\%} or 81{\%}. On the
other hand, variations in leaf N, LMA, C, delta, and their interactions
could statistically explain about 53{\%} and 26{\%} of variations in
A(grass) and A(canopy,) respectively.
7. We discussed possible biological and ecological processes involved in
regulating seasonal and inter-annual variability in ecosystem-level
photosynthesis. Clearly, seasonal and inter-annual variation in
ecosystem photosynthesis was strongly associated with the dynamics of
leaf traits.},

California arid lands, altering ecosystem processes and plant community
composition. With climate change, the Southwestern United States is
expected to experience increasingly variable rainfall. Larger rainfall
events could facilitate invasion by exotic species that can capitalize
on high resource conditions. Exotic annual species also have dense
shallow root systems that could create positive feedbacks to further
invasion by increasing soil organic matter and water holding capacity.
Alternatively, fine root inputs could create negative feedbacks to
exotic plant growth if they stimulate microbial nutrient immobilization.
The dual influences of rainfall regime and fine root inputs on species
performance were evaluated in an experiment where native and exotic
species were grown individually and in combination under varying
watering regimes (large infrequent or small frequent pulses, holding
total rainfall constant) and root additions (with or without sterilized
exotic roots). Mean soil moisture increased with larger infrequent
watering events, and also with root addition. Plant growth (both native
and exotic) increased with larger watering events, but declined with
root addition. Exotic species growth declined more than native species
growth with root additions. Mechanistically, root addition lowered
inorganic nitrogen (N) availability, and microbial N immobilization
increased with soil moisture content. Together these results show that
increased fine root production promotes negative feedbacks to growth of
exotic species via microbial N immobilization, especially under
conditions of high soil moisture. Further, our results suggest that
organic carbon additions are a potentially effective strategy for
suppressing growth of problematic desert invaders.},

growing season (fall, winter, and spring) are well-studied in California
grasslands, details about summer N cycling are scarce, presumably
because researchers assume that nothing biologically important happens
in soils during the hot, dry summer months when grasses are dead or
dormant. However, studying soil N dynamics over the summer is crucial to
understanding soil N availability at the beginning of the subsequent
growing season. To characterize the differences between summertime and

micro-organisms) and abiotic (e.g., mineral surfaces) consumers compete
for resources necessary for life (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus). This
competition is ecologically significant, since it regulates the dynamics
of soil nutrients and controls aboveground plant productivity. Here we
develop, calibrate and test a nutrient competition model that accounts
for multiple soil nutrients interacting with multiple biotic and abiotic
consumers. As applied here for tropical forests, the Nutrient
COMpetition model (N-COM) includes three primary soil nutrients (NH4+,
NO3- and POx; representing the sum of PO43-, HPO42- and H2PO4-) and five
potential competitors (plant roots, decomposing microbes, nitrifiers,
denitrifiers and mineral surfaces). The competition is formulated with a
quasi-steady-state chemical equilibrium approximation to account for
substrate (multiple substrates share one consumer) and consumer
(multiple consumers compete for one substrate) effects. N-COM
successfully reproduced observed soil heterotrophic respiration, N2O
emissions, free phosphorus, sorbed phosphorus and NH4+ pools at a
tropical forest site (Tapajos). The overall model uncertainty was
moderately well constrained. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that soil
nutrient competition was primarily regulated by consumer-substrate
affinity rather than environmental factors such as soil temperature or
soil moisture. Our results also imply that under strong nutrient
limitation, relative competitiveness depends strongly on the competitor
functional traits (affinity and nutrient carrier enzyme abundance). We
then applied the N-COM model to analyze field nitrogen and phosphorus
perturbation experiments in two tropical forest sites (in Hawaii and
Puerto Rico) not used in model development or calibration. Under soil
inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus elevated conditions, the model
accurately replicated the experimentally observed competition among
nutrient consumers. Although we used as many observations as we could
obtain, more nutrient addition experiments in tropical systems would
greatly benefit model testing and calibration. In summary, the N-COM

competition appropriate for land BGC models integrated in Earth System

the plant growth characteristics, we identified the contribution of each
data set variable to the variability in plant characteristics and, thus,
the predictive potential of each variable and data set. Within data set
1, EPD was important and in data set 2 the nutrient cycling index, which
is a landscape function index derived from soil surface attributes,
played the most important role in predicting potential. Principal
component analysis was used to provide weighting factors for each
indicator. We then transformed and combined observed indicator values
for each data set using weighting factors and scoring functions into an
additive soil quality index (SQI) varying in value from 0 to 1. The
SQIs, with values greater than 0.8, provide optimum conditions for high
yield.},
